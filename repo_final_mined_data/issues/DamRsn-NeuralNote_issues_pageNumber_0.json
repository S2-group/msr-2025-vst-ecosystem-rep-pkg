"body": "I've made NeuralNote build under Linux and was wondering if there is interest to upstream the changes. This PR would be the first step and contains the required changes to the code and the build system. The changes I was doing are:\r\n\r\n- Remove LTO when building for Linux as it was causing undefined reference issues\r\n- Refactor font loading into a singleton class to circumvent the \"static initialization catastrophe\" which seems to happen only under Linux since JUCE tries to read the `fonts.conf` XML file and the XML parser will use certain static strings that are not initialized at that time. I've written more about this here: https://github.com/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/33#issuecomment-1783775194\r\n- Create folder for NeuralNote inside the received temporary directory since NeuralNote would try to erase the whole `/tmp` directory otherwise, usually taking some temp-files of other applications with it\r\n\r\nThis change also requires an accompanying change to `libonnxruntime-neuralnote` to get a Linux build there which I have also available. But first wanted to start here to gauge interest in something like this.\r\n\r\nThere is another issue with external Drag&Drop not working properly in Linux. This seems to be a JUCE issue and I have a workaround available. But since this requires patching the external JUCE dependency I think that would probably be more suitable to put into the build scripts. Also, it's not strictly required for a Linux build.\r\n\r\nEdit: Link to patched `libonnxruntime-neuralnote`: https://github.com/polygon/libonnxruntime-neuralnote/tree/linux", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/85/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/85/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/84", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DamRsn/NeuralNote", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/84/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/84/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/84/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/DamRsn/NeuralNote/issues/84", "id": 1966474958, "node_id": "I_kwDOJE4tuM51NgbO", "number": 84, "title": "How can I use the built files in Xcode", "user": {"login": "KittenYang", "id": 5517281, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTcyODE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5517281?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang", "html_url": "https://github.com/KittenYang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/KittenYang/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2023-10-28T07:16:41Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T11:34:40Z", "closed_at": "2024-01-25T11:34:39Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "<img width=\"478\" alt=\"\u622a\u5c4f2023-10-28 15 16 00\" src=\"https://github.com/DamRsn/NeuralNote/assets/5517281/991d18c8-e6d5-46ed-8b93-5d8d32749e82\">\r\n\r\nI built those output, any ideas how to use it in Xcode?

Audio thumbnail management.\r\n \r\nThe recording is now done directly to 2 wav files (native sample rate and basic pitch sample rate) on separate threads thanks to `juce::ThreadedWriter`. There is no 3 minutes limit anymore. The saved files are deleted on a click of clear button.\r\n\r\nA timer is no longer used for the thumbnail, we simply use a `changeListener`.\r\n\r\n- New `AudioUtils` namespace handling audio file loading and resampling with static functions. \r\n- Fix bug in Resampler (there were some pops in 22.05 kHz audio due to  bad streaming resampling).", "reactions": {"url":
