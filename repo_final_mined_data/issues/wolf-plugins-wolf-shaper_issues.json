I only used it to format MenuWidget to fit the style of the rest of the code, but thought I'd include it since it might be useful to have project-wide formatting.\r\n- My variable names use snake_case instead of camelCase, can change that if necessary\r\n- I had to use chivo bold as the font. It seems the default font was disabled in upstream DPF because it wouldn't display any text unless I specified a font. That meant I had to change from a \u2713 to a regular dash because the font didn't seem to include that glyph. I think it still looks ok tho\r\n- We have to call a method on the top-level UI class to close the widget if the mouse goes out of bounds. With this configuration, instead of testing whether the mouse is outside of some bounds, we could just make it close whenever something else is clicked (like a control). I've left it testing if the mouse goes out of bounds but I don't think it would be hard to change the behaviour.\r\n- If window-manager based window resizing is implemented, then it might break the mouse bounds checking in the case where a menu is shown while the window is being resized. I think there is probably a callback/event we can use to fix that tho.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wolf-plugins/wolf-shaper/issues/150/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
