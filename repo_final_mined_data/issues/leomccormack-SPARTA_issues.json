One common way is looking at package receipts for this. \r\n\r\nWould it be possible for you to bump the package receipt version number when you release a new version so that they match? Currently the package receipt is on version 1.0 but the actual release number is 1.6.2 \r\n\r\n` pkg-ref id=\"com.sparta.pkg.\" version=\"1.0\" auth=\"Root\"` would become  `pkg-ref id=\"com.sparta.pkg.\" version=\"1.6.2\" auth=\"Root\"`\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration, and please let me know if you want any further clarification \r\n\r\nPaul", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/66/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/66/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65", "id": 1345343774, "node_id": "I_kwDOB0FoIs5QMFEe", "number": 65, "title": "Array2SH: The spatial correlation graph looks different...", "user": {"login": "marclava", "id": 50078614, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc4NjE0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50078614?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava", "html_url": "https://github.com/marclava", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-08-21T00:57:22Z", "updated_at": "2023-01-30T12:37:03Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-30T12:37:02Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "A screenshot of the spatial correlation graph for the eigenmike :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50078614/185770887-2721b619-9ef7-483a-8fd0-c821a275b48a.png)\r\n\r\nIt looks different than the one generated using the original MATLAB code \r\n(as seen at http://research.spa.aalto.fi/projects/spharrayproc-lib/spharrayproc.html) :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50078614/185770926-f91ab072-0453-4764-b70f-cea5dc08a91d.png)\r\n\r\nIs it different?
