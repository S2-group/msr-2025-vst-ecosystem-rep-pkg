After being linked, the user is shown a save confirmation in both DAW plugins and standalone editor. Ctrl+S also saves directly to the file.\r\n - DAW plugins store the (optional) linked file alongside project data. The project is linked to this when the DAW plugin data is restored, if the file can be found on the users disk.\r\n - In DAW plugins, there is some way to \"unlink\" a project file, possibly a menu option. This allows the user to effectively 'import' the project without having the save confirmation dialog (for a more natural DAW experience).\r\n - A \"New\" menu option to create a blank project should be added - this project would not be linked to any file by default.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/34/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/34/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/33", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/33/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/33/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/33/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/issues/33", "id": 338255704, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMzgyNTU3MDQ=", "number": 33, "title": "Node locking ability", "user": {"login": "cpdt", "id": 16081865, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDgxODY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16081865?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt", "html_url": "https://github.com/cpdt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 768947567, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw3Njg5NDc1Njc=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "84b6eb", "default": true, "description": null}, {"id": 960293498, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NjAyOTM0OTg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/labels/editor", "name": "editor", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to the graphical editor"}], "state": "open", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/milestones/5", "html_url": "https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/milestone/5", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/milestones/5/labels", "id": 3681570, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzY4MTU3MA==", "number": 5, "title": "0.5.0", "description": "Main Features include the exporter, XY control, scissors tool, oscilloscope visual, dB meter visual, an in-built keyboard and squashed bugs.", "creator": {"login": "Fire-wood", "id": 29534646, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTM0NjQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29534646?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood", "html_url": "https://github.com/Fire-wood", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 19, "closed_issues": 2, "state": "open", "created_at": "2018-09-24T09:04:29Z", "updated_at": "2019-03-24T19:39:04Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-07-04T12:25:57Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-24T09:10:30Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The user should be able to lock nodes, meaning the controls can't be moved or resized and the node can't be resized.

to have a nicer value form system then what's currently implemented.\r\n\r\nBasically, the current system tags each value with a form (eg linear, db, Q, note, freq, etc). A statement like `[lin] x` can then be used to convert the value in `x` to the linear form, internally using whatever form is stored in the value currently.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense in a localized environment, but when things start getting more complicated with interactive controls and connections, its harder to use and kinda error prone.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason here is the ambiguity of values:\r\n\r\n - There is a `control` form that represents a value as how it would be displayed on a control (mapping to [0,1] and applying curves). But this means that putting a value into/reading one out of a control requires manual conversion to `control`.\r\n - There is an ambiguously named `linear` form, which is simply meant to be a number with no form - converting to/from it always returns the same number.\r\n - The above point also means that, for example, there's no way to convert a dB value into a linear (ie multiply-able value)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/8/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/8/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/7", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/7/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/7/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/7/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/issues/7", "id": 316668219, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMTY2NjgyMTk=", "number": 7, "title": "Label Control", "user": {"login": "cpdt", "id": 16081865, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDgxODY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16081865?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt", "html_url": "https://github.com/cpdt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 768947567, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw3Njg5NDc1Njc=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "84b6eb", "default": true, "description": null}, {"id": 960293498, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NjAyOTM0OTg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/labels/editor", "name": "editor", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to the graphical editor"}], "state": "open", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/milestones/5", "html_url": "https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/milestone/5", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/milestones/5/labels", "id": 3681570, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzY4MTU3MA==", "number": 5, "title": "0.5.0", "description": "Main Features include the exporter, XY control, scissors tool, oscilloscope visual, dB meter visual, an in-built keyboard and squashed bugs.", "creator": {"login": "Fire-wood", "id": 29534646, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTM0NjQ2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29534646?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood", "html_url": "https://github.com/Fire-wood", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fire-wood/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 19, "closed_issues": 2, "state": "open", "created_at": "2018-09-24T09:04:29Z", "updated_at": "2019-03-24T19:39:04Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-04-23T05:41:56Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-24T09:08:12Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "As part of [Controls Part II](https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/wiki/Controls-Part-II) a new label control should be created.
