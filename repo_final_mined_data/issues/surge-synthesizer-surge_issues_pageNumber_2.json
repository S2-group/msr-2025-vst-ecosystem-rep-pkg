I'm trying to create a TouchOSC template for Surge XT and I can only seem to get OSC output (i.e. /q/all_params) to TouchOSC if it's running on the same computer as the synth.  I can only find OSC input and Output port settings but not an output IP address setting.   It appears that all output goes to 127.0.0.1. \r\n\r\nHere's the version info from Surge XT:\r\n\r\nVersion: Surge XT 1.3.0.20a8e16\r\nBuild: 2023-12-08 @ 12:56:16 on 'Mac-1702036315614.local/pipeline' with 'AppleClang-14.0.0.14000029' using JUCE 7.0.5\r\nSystem: macOS 64-bit Standalone on Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz / Process block size: 32 samples\r\n \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7432/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7432/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7431", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7431/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7431/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7431/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7431", "id": 2067775256, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes57P78Y", "number": 7431, "title": "Linux mint 20, reaper 6.79, surge xt 1.3.0.

Currently, to keep the TouchOSC interface in sync with Surge, I have to get a number of different params when changing oscillator types. This is because the osc-types have different controls for param 1-7 and so when changing osc-types I just query for all parameter info. \r\n\r\nWhen switching from osc-type 'String' to 'Twist', and immediately fetching all params, Surge will reliably crash on Mac OS.\r\nI'm sending these OSC messages:\r\n```\r\n/param/a/osc/1/type 10\r\n/q/all_params\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm away from home right now and don't have a linux box on hand to test other setups.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\n* Version: 1.3.0.20a8e16\r\n* Plugin Type: Standalone\r\n* Bitness: 64-bit\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nAs described, using TouchOS. \r\nIn the testscript used by @pkstone, adding and running the following code will crash Surge.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef trigger_crash():\r\n    msg = obp.OSCMessage(\"/param/a/osc/1/type\", \",f\", [9.0])\r\n    osc_send(msg, \"oscout\")\r\n    osc_process()\r\n    \r\n    msg = obp.OSCMessage(\"/param/a/osc/1/type\", \",f\", [10.0])\r\n    osc_send(msg, \"oscout\")\r\n    osc_process()\r\n    \r\n    msg = obp.OSCMessage(\"/q/all_params\", \",\", [])\r\n    osc_send(msg, \"oscout\")\r\n    osc_process()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nAfter changing the osc type, Surge sends OSC messages for all of its params.\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: Mac OS 13.6.1\r\n - Host: Standalone\r\n\r\nAttached is a crashlog generated by Mac OS.\r\n[surge_crashlog_231225.txt](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/files/13767103/surge_crashlog_231225.txt)\r\n", "reactions":

installed either from the official .deb or compiled and installed from github `main`, the whole screen turns black, the exception being some individual UI widgets which happen to repaint and thus appear. Mousing over widgets sometimes triggers a repaint and thus makes them visible, but this only lasts so long before everything draws as black again.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\n1.3.0 x86_64\r\n2-bit or 64-bit]\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nRun the app.\r\n\r\nWait about 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nSee the screen turn black.\r\n\r\nMouse over some widgets. They may appear.\r\n\r\nGood luck exiting the app! (The x button is still active, if you can find it.)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nThe app should display fully, without drawing the entire screen black.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n![image](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/assets/733906/6b67c209-d597-46d1-8894-92aa8d63be19)\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the

My thinking is for some parameters (EG's, Formula and MSEG Rate, maybe others too) it would be such a toss-up whether the tempo-sync rounding would sound cool or just break the patch completely that those should probably be omitted.

However, it is not clear how to do this in Surge.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\n1) Ideally, there would be an XML format that captures the complete state of the synthesizer, nothing missing (https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6627)\r\nThe test suite for this could have scripts to roundtrip from FXP to XML and back, to make sure they are identical. I would be happy to contribute.\r\n2) The Python API could be extended. If it is incomplete, an XML solution would be preferable.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\nIDK.\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\nI've made a lot of progress in getting AI to
