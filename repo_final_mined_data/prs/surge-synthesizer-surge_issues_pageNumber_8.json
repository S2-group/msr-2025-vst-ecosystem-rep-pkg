request related to a problem? Please describe!**\r\n\r\nMy only problem with Surge is being able to only see a single oscillator onscreen at once. Surge is a fabulous synth but I find myself often avoiding using it because of slow access to oscillators. It's not that switching between oscillators is so slow, but I feel like I'm always worried about what's on the other oscillator page. I find it's a kinda \"stressful\" UI because of the oscillator switching. Surge would be so much cooler if you could relax and just look at one page. I think it's a design priority problem that we have access to 8 macro slots yet access to the oscillators is more limited.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if there could be a new \"wide\" UI mode that presents all three oscillators onscreen simultaneously. This could help to make Surge more hands-on friendly. I realize there would be more onscreen but looking at three oscillators instead of 1 is not that difficult, and perhaps a new skin could color code background areas of the different synthesis sections.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6841/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6841/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6840", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6840/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6840/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6840/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6840", "id": 1573030152, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes5dwokI", "number": 6840, "title": "Likely streaming issue with comb filter tuning", "user": {"login": "Andreya-Autumn", "id": 105538426, "node_id": "U_kgDOBkpjeg", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105538426?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn", "html_url": "https://github.com/Andreya-Autumn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2176487016, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc2NDg3MDE2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Bug%20Report", "name": "Bug Report", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Item submitted using the Bug Report template"}, {"id": 3248300442, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMjQ4MzAwNDQy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Patch%20Browser", "name": "Patch Browser", "color": "6CD57B", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/31", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/31", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/31/labels", "id": 8570089, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCOvoes4AgsTp", "number": 31, "title": "Surge XT 1.2", "description": "Guess we are doing a 1.2!\r\n\r\n~~We want to release 1.1 soon but it will be forever and a day before 2, and we won't do a 1.2, so this is a milestone for stuff we want to do in occasional point releases.~~\r\n", "creator": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 56, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2022-10-22T18:56:10Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-17T20:49:52Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2023-04-10T14:34:40Z"}, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2023-02-06T18:01:03Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-07T10:02:08Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-07T10:02:08Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Load Dan Maurer -

It would be good to have a clear loudness target for patch creators, and it would also be good if the factory patches all hit that target.\r\n\r\nTricky thing as always is: human-perceived loudness is only weakly correlated with peak levels. \r\nIt would be trivial to automatically adjust all patches to peak at -1db under reasonable playing conditions, but that would result in some patches sounding much louder than others.\r\n\r\nLUFS is the closest thing we have to a measurement of actual perceived loudness. In order to avoid doing all this work manually, it'd be useful to make a little tester that takes a MIDI input, plays it with all relevant patches, then outputs a LUFS readout for each patch. \r\n\r\nIt should be able to do this per category, since mono vs poly, bass vs lead etc etc will require different test MIDI cases. \r\n\r\nThis will help: https://github.com/klangfreund/LUFSMeter",

subject, sorry if this has come up before but, when dealing with tree views such as the patch browser tree view and the configuration tree, is there any way to make the cursor retain its position after an option has been selected? In this way, once a patch has been selected, you could carry on your keyboard browsing from that point and when, for example, making changes to the workflow menu to optimise accessibility, you would have to keep renavigating the tree again.\r\n\r\nbaconpaul \u2014 Today at 8:03 AM\r\n> There is `PopupMenu::Options:::withInitiallySelectedItem (int idOfItemToBeSelected) const;` which we might be able to use.

Load template \"Init Saw\"\r\n2. Add Nimbus effect to first FX on chain A.\r\n3. Click on \"S-LFO 1\". Change it to the template \"Basic ADSR\".\r\n4.

Changing `patch_name` in the script [here](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/tuning_example.py#L19) plays midi note 0 with the Bass 1 patch, producing `bass_1.wav`. Listening to the two wav files, `bass_1.wav` has a pitch a major third below `dx_ep.wav`. This corresponds to the `5/4` in the scl file [here](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/example.scl#L9); changing the 5/4 moves the pitch Bass 1 plays (the DX EP pitch remains the same).\r\n\r\nI also saw this behaviour in Reaper by:\r\n- Creating a new project and track\r\n- Adding Surge XT to the track FX\r\n- Setting the patch to DX EP\r\n- Loading the [scl](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/example.scl) and [kbm](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/example.kbm) files \r\n- Adding the Midi Sequencer Baby before Surge XT\r\n- Setting the sequencer to loop midi note 0 and playing the track\r\n- Switching between the DX EP and Bass 1 patches\r\n\r\nThis leads to the pitch moving by a major third when I switch between the patches\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nI would expect that the pitches produced when using the DX EP and Bass 1 patches would be the same. In particular the DX EP pitch is the one I would expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: Linux (Arch Linux)\r\n - Host: Python and Reaper\r\n - Version: Python 3.10, Reaper v6.69\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nThis is a minimal example of something I ran into when using retuning with a just intonation sequencer I am working on. Using different patches for different parts in a song was changing the pitch of some parts. I made the scl and kbm files above with Scale Workshop to be safe.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6804/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,

I've been using Surge in a command line just intonation sequencer I'm writing in Python, so Surge's tuning support and Python API have been super useful :)\r\n\r\nIt would be handy for me to be able to include surgepy as a dependency for my project, so I had a look at packaging it as a Python package. It turns out there is a tool [scikit-build](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) specifically for packaging Python extensions built with CMake. In case it would be of interest, this PR is to make surgepy installable as a Python package using scikit-build. It's based on the scikit-build pybind example project [here](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-sample-projects/tree/master/projects/hello-pybind11).\r\n\r\nWith this branch you can run\r\n```\r\npython3 -m pip install <REPO_DIR>\r\n```\r\non the surge repo to build and install surgepy as a Python package. I've used this to install surgepy in a Python virtual environment to use for development.\r\n\r\nAlso I've built a Python binary wheel for surgepy so I can install it without building it every time. I tested installing the wheel in a Ubuntu VM and it works. Using wheels it would be possible to create a surgepy package on PyPI so people could `pip install surgepy` and it would just work.\r\n\r\nThank you again for Surge!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6790/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6790/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6789", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6789/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6789/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6789/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6789", "id": 1526049271, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes5a9an3", "number": 6789, "title": "Browser switches from Factory to User Patches if a category with the same name exists in User Patches", "user": {"login": "VincyZed", "id": 50145178, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTQ1MTc4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50145178?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed", "html_url": "https://github.com/VincyZed", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1829061756, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDYxNzU2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/UX", "name": "UX", "color": "42d9f7", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to user experience (UX) - mouse, touch, keyboard, MIDI inputs, etc."}, {"id": 2176487016, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc2NDg3MDE2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Bug%20Report", "name": "Bug Report", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Item submitted using the Bug Report template"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/23", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/23", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/23/labels", "id": 6346441, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjM0NjQ0MQ==", "number": 23, "title": "Surge XT 2.0", "description": "Next level Surge!\r\n\r\nThis milestone presents a solid book of work we have slated for the next major Surge XT release, after the initial one we have released in Jan 2022.

Nothing w ecan do about people who streamed in the past but this will fix it going forward.\r\n\r\nCloses #6573", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6785/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6785/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6784", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6784/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6784/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6784/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6784", "id": 1524922291, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes5a5Hez", "number": 6784, "title": "Use wavetables as a waveshaper shape", "user": {"login": "VincyZed", "id": 50145178, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTQ1MTc4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50145178?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed", "html_url": "https://github.com/VincyZed", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/VincyZed/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1064039352, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDY0MDM5MzUy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Feature%20Request", "name": "Feature Request", "color": "a2eeef", "default": false, "description": "New feature request"}, {"id": 1178867708, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMTc4ODY3NzA4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/DSP", "name": "DSP", "color": "e881ef", "default": false, "description": "Issues and feature requests related to sound generation in the synth"}, {"id": 1829061756, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDYxNzU2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/UX", "name": "UX", "color": "42d9f7", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to user experience (UX) - mouse, touch, keyboard, MIDI inputs, etc."}, {"id": 2110134353, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTEwMTM0MzUz", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Requires%20Param%20List%20Change", "name": "Requires Param List Change", "color": "c0d85f", "default": false, "description": "To accomplish this issue we need to be able to modify the DAW params in all our hosts"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/8", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/8", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/8/labels", "id": 4721570, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDcyMTU3MA==", "number": 8, "title": "Currently Unscheduled", "description": "We put issues in this milestone if they are not currently scheduled in our book of work.
