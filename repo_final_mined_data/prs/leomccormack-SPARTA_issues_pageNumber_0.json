One common way is looking at package receipts for this. \r\n\r\nWould it be possible for you to bump the package receipt version number when you release a new version so that they match? Currently the package receipt is on version 1.0 but the actual release number is 1.6.2 \r\n\r\n` pkg-ref id=\"com.sparta.pkg.\" version=\"1.0\" auth=\"Root\"` would become  `pkg-ref id=\"com.sparta.pkg.\" version=\"1.6.2\" auth=\"Root\"`\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration, and please let me know if you want any further clarification \r\n\r\nPaul", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/66/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/66/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/65", "id": 1345343774, "node_id": "I_kwDOB0FoIs5QMFEe", "number": 65, "title": "Array2SH: The spatial correlation graph looks different...", "user": {"login": "marclava", "id": 50078614, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc4NjE0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50078614?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava", "html_url": "https://github.com/marclava", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marclava/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-08-21T00:57:22Z", "updated_at": "2023-01-30T12:37:03Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-30T12:37:02Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "A screenshot of the spatial correlation graph for the eigenmike :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50078614/185770887-2721b619-9ef7-483a-8fd0-c821a275b48a.png)\r\n\r\nIt looks different than the one generated using the original MATLAB code \r\n(as seen at http://research.spa.aalto.fi/projects/spharrayproc-lib/spharrayproc.html) :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50078614/185770926-f91ab072-0453-4764-b70f-cea5dc08a91d.png)\r\n\r\nIs it different?

"When loading a loudspeaker configuration, it appears that there is an upper limit to the channel ID of a non-imaginary speaker (`\"Channel\"` in the JSON file), beyond which Reaper crashes.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem to be a problem if the speaker is imaginary (i.e. `\"IsImaginary\": true` in the JSON file).\r\n\r\nExample: I have a 76-channel array. 38 are real, 38 imaginary. If the real channels are in the first half of the configuration (channels 1-38), it loads fine. If the real channels are in the second half (channels 38-76), reaper crashes when the config file is loaded.\r\n\r\nNarrowing down a bit, I took the breaking case (channels 38-76 are real) and trimmed channels until reaper didn't crash. Real channels up to Channel ID 69 are OK, but breaks at 70. Changing Channel 70 to be imaginary and it works again.\r\n\r\nThe 4 attached config files illustrate the above cases (GItHub required them to be `.txt` so should be converted back to `.json`).\r\n[ls_config_VBAP_38real_70okIfImaginary.txt](https://github.com/leomccormack/SPARTA/files/7796314/ls_config_VBAP_38real_70okIfImaginary.txt)\r\n[ls_config_VBAP_76ch_secondHalfReal_BREAKS.txt](https://github.com/leomccormack/SPARTA/files/7796316/ls_config_VBAP_76ch_secondHalfReal_BREAKS.txt)\r\n[ls_config_VBAP_76ch_firstHalfReal_OK.txt](https://github.com/leomccormack/SPARTA/files/7796315/ls_config_VBAP_76ch_firstHalfReal_OK.txt)\r\n[ls_config_VBAP_38real_69ok.txt](https://github.com/leomccormack/SPARTA/files/7796312/ls_config_VBAP_38real_69ok.txt)\r\n\r\nI'd say the max Channel ID of a real loudspeaker is 69, but that number may just be 'magic', in that it could be somehow related to the total number of channels, number of specified track channels (I'm using 38 or 40), or something specific to this configuration and how the triangulation/inversion is performed in by SAF.\r\n\r\nPanner version 1.5.8\r\nReaper version 6.26", "reactions": {"url":

This is the same in the case of controlling them using OSC messages (which is what ultimately I'm trying to do).  What's strange is that the automation values in the track header do change (both the red knob and the green number). Additionally, the only way for automation to be written is if I manually move the red knob in the track header (see attached image for reference), doing this also changes the parameter in the plugin.

I measured the MMD decoder in AmbiDEC and I see that the resulting rV magnitude is 1.5 instead of 1. In fact all the decoders other than the AllRAD gave me that magnitude. Could there be a bug somewhere inside the SAF? I know it could also be my measuring method, but I also measured the decoding matrix returned by the PINV method within the [Ambisonics Decoder Toolbox](https://bitbucket.org/ambidecodertoolbox/adt/src/master/) and that one is correct (rV=1).
