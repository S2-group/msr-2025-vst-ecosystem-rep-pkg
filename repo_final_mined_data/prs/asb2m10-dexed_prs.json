"User story: As a user, I would like to put voice data into my MIDI track that is being played by Dexed in a DAW (the one that contains the notes to be played). When playing MIDI from the track, the voice data from the sysex should be loaded into the Dexed VST. My use case i that I would like to script loading voice data into Dexed inside Reaper.\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems that Dexed only accepts sysex over the MIDI device set under PARM as \"MIDI In\".\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it would also accept sysex coming in from the MIDI track that is being played. Just like it plays MIDI notes, it should also load MIDI sysex. This way, MIDI notes and MIDI sysex could be saved together on the same track in the DAW. This would allow to automate (by scripting the DAW) the setup of multiple layers (tracks) in TX816 style.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/assets/2480569/6a882951-76d4-4e92-9ec0-f0ad4e4360e6)\r\n\r\nIn the picture, each of the tracks TG1...TG8 contains a sysex (\"SYX\") with the voice data that should be played by the Dexed instance that is on the respective track.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nhttps://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/discussions/352", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/401/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/401/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400", "id": 2017264181, "node_id": "I_kwDOAOR7V854PQI1", "number": 400, "title": "Expose .syx files as JSON or vstpreset?", "user": {"login": "turian", "id": 65918, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65918?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian", "html_url": "https://github.com/turian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-11-29T19:21:33Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-29T19:21:33Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "There are many .syx files floating around, but the file format is hard to understand.
