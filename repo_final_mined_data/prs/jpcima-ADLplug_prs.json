I'm using Wohlstand's OPL3 Bank Editor to view and create Adlib patches from/for Sierra SCI adventure games which use a very similar format to Adlib's BNK format. However, Sierra SCI games do not support rhythm banks for OPL2. Only melodic. While I'm composing for a custom SCI game or previewing Adlib music tracks from existing SCI games with SCI Companion or SCI Viewer, there is MIDI data used for OPL2 on channel 10 but it's meant to reference one of the standard melodic patches (or many melodic patches, one at a time via MIDI program change commands) and not a rhythm patch. If there was an option to be able to change any MIDI channel from rhythm to melodic and vice versa that would solve my issue.\r\n\r\nMy request/suggestion is to keep the default setting as rhythm for channel 10, but allow the user to change it for strange cases like mine. Or perhaps compatibility with some other MIDI standard that uses percussion on a channel other than 10 (such as XG or Base MIDI or something?).

However, I do have two regular issues with the UI\r\n\r\n1) The relationship between cores and algorithms.\r\nSelecting 4 op in \"Algorithm\" doesn't automatically add a 4 op to \"Core\". Can be hard to identify the cause of no sound when creating a 4 op patch from an initialized patch. Annoying but easy to overcome once you remember it.\r\n\r\n2) The relationship between algorithm mode and modulation type.\r\nThis is a much harder challenge, because behavior changes based on whether 2, 2x2 or 4 op is selected.\r\n\r\n2 op mode\r\nCurrently, you put a transparency over OP3 and OP4, you may consider doing so for FM 3-4, AM 3-4 and Feedback 3-4 just to reduce visual clutter. Not strictly necessary.\r\n\r\n2x2 op mode\r\nThese are chained together pretty sensibly, so the relationship is pretty easy. It's fine.\r\n\r\n4 op mode\r\nIt's difficult to remember the routing relationship other than \"FM-FM\" since that just chains them all together. I know that addressing this may require some rather large changes to the UI but some suggestions: \r\na) Add a \"?\" or hint with a link to a diagram (probably just 4 op, but 2 op could be useful)\r\nb) Add a diagram directly into the UI. This is common, but less critical with so few effective algorithms.\r\nc) Add a read-only text field similar to the one in OPNplug. \r\n\r\nExamples for c)\r\n4 op \r\n[AM-FM: 1+(2->3->4)] \r\n\r\n2x2 op \r\n[AM-FM: 1+2+(3->4)] \r\n\r\n2 op \r\n[FM: (1->2)]\r\n\r\nRelated; I don't think Feedback 3-4 has any function in 4 op mode, so that might be good to obscure as well.\r\n\r\nI tend to refer to these site fairly often for their diagrams.\r\nhttps://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~arnost/opl/opl3.html\r\nhttps://www.polynominal.com/yamaha-opl3/", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/69/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/69/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/68", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/68/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/68/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/68/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug/pull/68", "id": 717897854, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTAwMzgzMDM4", "number": 68, "title": "update JUCE LV2 branch to the latest JUCE6 and enable VST3 build on Linux", "user": {"login": "atsushieno", "id": 53929, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTI5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53929?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno", "html_url": "https://github.com/atsushieno", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/atsushieno/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2020-10-09T06:42:02Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-12T09:01:57Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-12T09:01:57Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/pulls/68", "html_url": "https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug/pull/68", "diff_url": "https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug/pull/68.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug/pull/68.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "It ist most unlikely ideal (because it is currently killing VeSTige based VST2 build), but based on https://github.com/jpcima/JUCE/pull/5, this brings in VST3 support.

Recently, I decided to give it a try on Linux Mint 20--unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nAfter installing from the deb files, an error message pops up reading \"Could not create a new audio client. Please start the JACK server and try again.\" I did not have JACK beforehand, so I installed it, (re)started the server, and tried again as the message told. However, that did not solve my problem. Logs from qjackctl do show the server received requests from the two programs, but the same error occurs before any further execution proceeds.\r\n\r\nI honestly do not know much about JACK itself. Are there any steps I missed to get these to work properly on my system? If so, please enlighten me like I am a Linux newbie.\r\n\r\nAs I could not resolve the previous issue after many attempts, I went on to build without using the JACK flag (-DADLplug_Jack=OFF). Unfortunately, the build fails with a compiler error stating \"cannot bind packed field\", which points to a JUCE issue.
