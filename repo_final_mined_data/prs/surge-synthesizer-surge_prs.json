\"buttons\" on the top allows to pick what you want, the leftmost column will be useful just for the 3rd party, then all the available categories (depending on what's picked on the leftmost column), then all the patches in the categories, with a scrollbar to go down.\r\n\r\nAs SurgeXT already indexes the patches (for the Search feature) i think that a browser like that could be feasible.",

presets ssymlinked inside).\r\nDue to an error in the batch file i've made to do that, one link is pointing to an inexistent file.\r\n\r\nWhen Surge XT browses the user patches folder this results in a fatal error and it closes.\r\nIf it was the VST in my DAW (FLStudio) the DAW crashes to desktop.\r\nIf instead it was the SurgeXT standalone, it produces the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\n* Version:\r\nPlugin Type: VST3 64-bit\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nI think it SurgeXT should handle the problem more gracefull. ignoring the \"bad\" patch (missing the file in this case) and not listing it, or maybe showing it in a different way in the patces broswer.\r\nAnyway, it should not close and cause the DAW to crash.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n![image](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/assets/9556348/e68400a0-a5f8-47e9-ac16-6a73728e9f7d)\r\n\r\n - Windows 10\r\n - Host: Any, the standalone version

Please describe!**\r\nI'm only using Surge XT _**standalone version**_ (thx for doing it too, besides the plugin ones).\r\nMy problem is that when I'm loading a patch for a song, I've always have to set the tempo of the song manualy (on the left side of the virtual keyboard of Surge).\r\nAfter a fresh start, Surge XT standalone always set the tempo at 120 bpm. This value seems to be hard coded since I could not find in any config file a way to set another default (or start up) value.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\nI would like that Surge saves the current tempo value in the current loaded patch when I'm saving/overwritting it.\r\nWhen used as a DAW plugin, Surge XT could simply ignore this parameter of the patch, since Surge should receive the current tempo value from the DAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\nNo idea...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\nI'm using Surge XT standalone in Debian 12 (stable with KDE Plasma) on an used Dell Latitude 7200 2-in-1 (only with touch screen). Surge XT is controlled by a hardware MIDI keyboard Nektar Impact GX61. Audio output over the onboard sound card (phone output) of the Dell Latitude.\r\nIt's a killer standalone instrument for < 400,- EUR!!!\r\n(and I'm also using Dexed and other software synths on this cheap but powerful hardware)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7529/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7529/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528", "id": 2151052973, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes6ANnat", "number": 7528, "title": "macOS based latency in standalone with audio input", "user": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1178875892, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMTc4ODc1ODky", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/macOS", "name": "macOS", "color": "1e32b5", "default": false, "description": "macOS related issues"}, {"id": 2176487016, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc2NDg3MDE2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Bug%20Report", "name": "Bug Report", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Item submitted using the Bug Report template"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/28", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28/labels", "id": 8227677, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCOvoes4AfYtd", "number": 28, "title": "Surge XT 1.x", "description": "Things we could do in the 1.x family but didn't make 1.2 or 1.3", "creator": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 60, "closed_issues": 3, "state": "open", "created_at": "2022-07-22T12:11:50Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-04T08:57:18Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-02-23T13:06:17Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-26T23:49:08Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "On macOS 14.x the 1.3 standalone, when input is bound to the MacBook pro microphone (and perhaps other inputs) has a noticeable playback latency independent of output block size.\r\n\r\nTo test open surge in logic and simultaneously open the standalone.
