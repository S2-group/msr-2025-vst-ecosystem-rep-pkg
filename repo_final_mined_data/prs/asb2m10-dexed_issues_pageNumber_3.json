MPE works by assigning each note to its own MIDI channel so that particular messages can be applied to each note individually.\r\n>\r\n> Instruments like the Continuum Fingerboard, Linnstrument, ROLI Seaboard, and Eigenharp let users control pitch, timbre, and other nuances for individual notes within chords. A growing number of soft synths and effects are also compatible with MPE, as well as a few hardware synths.\r\n\r\nHere is [Roger Linn's explanation](http://www.rogerlinndesign.com/mpe.html) on why MPE was needed.\r\n\r\nHere is the [MIDI Association's article](https://www.midi.org/articles-old/midi-polyphonic-expression-mpe) with a link to the ***technical specification*** (free registration required to download it.) The specification goes to great lengths to describe zones, master channels, and other concepts, so I think it's an essential resource for anybody interested in implementing this.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about getting one of these fancy new controllers and I'd love to use Dexed with it. Unfortunately, I did some tests in Bitwig and I couldn't get per-note pitch bend to work, no matter how I set up the MIDI channels or MPE settings.

I didn't found any workaround, even removing Dexed from the track is not enough to restore this function. When you quit Ardour, it asks you if you want to save or just quit, if you choose to save it tells you that Ardour was not able to save the project.     \r\n\r\nI have this problem with a current project of mine, but I was not able however to reproduce it straightaway with a blank project.

I see DX21 sysex import in the TODO of README. There's a DXconvert program for that, and unless there's some real magic tricks, it'd just be an approximation.\r\n\r\nRather than convert the sysex, why not a 4-op edit mode? Add in the TX81Z waveforms. That way, we get the lo-fi 4-op feel, with the added modulation capabilities of TX81Z, which would be awesome! :) And sounds from the arcade/games (YM2151, YM2612/YM2608) would sound closer to the real thing with a 4-op engine, since they use similar internals (YM2164 uses the same pinout and memory map as YM2151 which has tons of documentation/code).\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? I don't think it'd be too hard since they are just a slightly simplified version of DX7's FM engine. The parameters layout would have to change. The only thing that makes the keyboards unique from the Arcades is the firmware which controls 'voice parameters', keyboard scaling/velocity sensitivity, pitch envelope generator. All of that extra stuff is already handled in Dexed.\r\n\r\nAlso, the 4-op algorithm list are the same used in the Yamaha DX9, which are a subset of DX7 algorithms with operators 1 and 2 disabled. :) \r\n\r\nDoes this have a place in Dexed, maybe a pull request if you're not up to it?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/163/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/163/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/162", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/162/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/162/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/162/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/162", "id": 361400722, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzNjE0MDA3MjI=", "number": 162, "title": "Export txt file with 32 patches name", "user": {"login": "ballacr75", "id": 4078853, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzg4NTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4078853?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75", "html_url": "https://github.com/ballacr75", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ballacr75/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2018-09-18T17:10:47Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-09T02:57:27Z", "closed_at": "2018-10-09T02:57:27Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hi, it will be wonderful if there is a button or context menu with \"export to txt\" that create a txt file with the same name of the loaded syx cartdrige containing the list of 32 patch name and all the parameter for each patch!

Single voices send ok also.\r\n\r\n I did a test with KMidimon to monitor the midi through connector on the DX7 as Dexed tries to send a cartridge.\r\nThis loopback test showed that only 3840 bytes looped back.\r\nSo the Linux system is not transmitting the full 4104 bytes.\r\n\r\n![midi_through_sysex_capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18003792/43873787-1802baae-9b56-11e8-9723-eb1cb0ec3728.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n If I capture a cartridge from the DX7 using KMidimon, it shows that Linux seems to be splitting the 4104 sysex into 256 byte buffers.\r\nI can then use KMidimon to play back this capture to the DX7 and it successfully transfers the sysex

if Dexed can send the cartridge in 2 or more smaller buffers, rather than one large one. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am using the Roland UM-ONE MK2, and I also tried with a generic usb midi

in the changelog that there have been some recent changes to how `all-notes-off` MIDI events are handled. It seems that something is still not working correctly (I don't know if it worked correctly prior to those changes).\r\n\r\nIf I do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Start up [Rosegarden](https://rosegardenmusic.com/).\r\n2. Start up [Carla](https://github.com/falkTX/Carla/).\r\n3. Create a new `Dexed.so` VST instance in Carla. Select a patch that will play a sustained note for as long as a key is held.\r\n4. Create a MIDI track in Rosegarden and connect the MIDI output of Rosegarden to the `events` input of Dexed.\r\n4. Write some long notes on the MIDI track. Press play and then stop playback in the middle of one of those long notes (so that `note-off` isn't reached).\r\n\r\nAt this point, Dexed will sustain the last note that it received forever. There appears to be no way to shut it up aside from manually toggling the MONO switch on and off on the synth.\r\n\r\nI don't think Rosegarden is to blame here, as I've used the various MIDI inspector plugins in Carla to verify that Rosegarden is sending `all-notes-off` events on all channels.\r\n\r\nThis is actually a serious usability issue, as every time you happen to stop playback in the middle of a note, you then have to go into all of your Dexed instances and toggle the MONO switch to stop them blaring at you.\r\n\r\nI'm on Arch Linux. Dexed is compiled from the latest git master (`73a266dd70e58e7def14a52bf2a53b5486d083dc`).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/152/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/152/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/151", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/151/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/151/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/151/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/151", "id": 339266361, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMzkyNjYzNjE=", "number": 151, "title": "macOS Dexed standalone plays back with bizarre frozen flanger quality", "user": {"login": "PeterFrampgun", "id": 18745051, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQ1MDUx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18745051?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun", "html_url": "https://github.com/PeterFrampgun", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/PeterFrampgun/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2018-07-08T23:07:55Z", "updated_at": "2019-01-03T03:48:22Z", "closed_at": "2019-01-03T03:48:22Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I'm on macOS 10.13.5 using Dexed 0.9.4.

The original DX7 will play each operators second-rate/envelope at different times because the first rate is set to varying slow rates. While it is puzzling that this happens when you see a rate of 5 going to level 0 from level 0, it can be delightful to get a sudden change or addition to the sound seconds after your keypress down and although Yamaha thought of this, their implementation is also buggy. On the  original DX7, you will get a correct version or a condensed version. This seems to be related to how many of the previous 16 notes were held down to play past Rate/Level 2. Notes held long enough will play normal  and the others will play a faster condensed version. Your version is mathematically correct in that a rate of 5 will still take 0 milliseconds going from Levels 0 to 0, but it takes the fun out of it. The Yamaha implementation meant that it was unpredictable so it wasn't used much by programmers but your implementation could. \r\nI'm afraid my DX7 with E! got hit with a power surge and is now only capable of sending MIDI or I'd attach an audio file.\r\nI'd like to suggest that a zero level change still take 10 ms per level. Perhaps the times could be altered logarithmically. If you are checking your DX7 results remember to first hold down 16 keys for about 15 seconds after which you will hear what it is supposed to sound like. \r\nRick", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/137/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/137/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/136", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/136/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/136/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/136/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/136", "id": 313288328, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMTMyODgzMjg=", "number": 136, "title": "Poly aftertouch interpreted as pitch bend", "user": {"login": "nesdnuma", "id": 6513218, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTMyMTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6513218?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma", "html_url": "https://github.com/nesdnuma", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nesdnuma/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2018-04-11T11:44:28Z", "updated_at": "2018-05-05T04:27:45Z", "closed_at": "2018-04-26T03:06:02Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've just noticed this issue in Reaper 64-bit: poly aftertouch messages are interpreted as pitch bend messages.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/136/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/136/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/135", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/135/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/135/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/135/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/135", "id": 312781867, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMTI3ODE4Njc=", "number": 135, "title": "Sysex messages force pitch bend messages", "user": {"login": "papwalker", "id": 21151455, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTUxNDU1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21151455?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker", "html_url": "https://github.com/papwalker", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/papwalker/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 25, "created_at": "2018-04-10T05:52:55Z", "updated_at": "2018-05-08T02:48:23Z", "closed_at": "2018-05-03T03:57:40Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Using High Sierra.\r\nIf there are any **_Yamaha_** USB keyboards or synths plugged in and active, Dexed 0.9.4 a sound short tone will sound after Key Off or  will generate a continuous tone depending on which host is used.

makes it very difficult to use an external controller with dexed.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/96/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

"active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Detune is currently implemented as a fixed Hertz increment.  When looking at dx7note.cc, I see the following comment:  \"This was measured at 7.213Hz per count at 9600Hz, but the exact value is somewhat dependent on midinote. Close enough for now.\"\r\n\r\nOn patches that use detune strategically, this causes detune-based chorusing type effects to be the wrong speed as you move around the keyboard and is a noticeable difference between Dexed and a real DX7.  For reference, watch this video where it is apparent:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjsJeybu85I   (I didn't make the video, but it did bring this issue to my attention.)\r\n\r\nThe correct behavior is to detune by cents instead of Hertz.  (ie, the detune amount is relative to the note pitch and not a fixed amount.)\r\n\r\nAccording to the DX7II manual, the range is +/- 2 cents.  So a detune of -7 is -2 cents and a detune of +7 is +2 cents.  I do not know how the values between +/- 1-7 are mapped to the +/- 0-2 cent range and would have to measure a real instrument to determine it, but even a linear interpolation between values would be much better than the current fixed frequency approximation.\r\n\r\nYour noted measurement in the comment suggests that the original DX7 might have a different, wider, detuning range than the stated range for a DX7II if I'm understanding it correctly.  (2 cents is a 1.001156 frequency ratio, which would be about +/- 11 Hz at 9600 Hz)  (Those values are based upon the pitch conversion tools here:  http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-centsratio.htm )\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that improving the implementation of operator detune would be an important change to make for at least the Mark I engine.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/88/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/88/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
