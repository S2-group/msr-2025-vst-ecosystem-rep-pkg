That\nin turn means that match offsets that split a codepoint could be reported,\nwhich in turn results in panicking when one uses them to slice a <code>&amp;str</code>.</p>\n<p>This bug occurred in the transition to <code>regex 1.8</code> because the underlying\nsyntactical error that prevented this regex from compiling was intentionally\nremoved. That's because <code>(?-u:\\B)</code> will be permitted in Unicode regexes in\n<code>regex 1.9</code>, but the matching engines will guarantee to never report match\noffsets that split a codepoint. When the underlying syntactical error was\nremoved, no code was added to ensure that <code>(?-u:\\B)</code> didn't compile in the\n<code>regex 1.8</code> transition release. This release, <code>regex 1.8.4</code>, adds that code\nsuch that <code>Regex::new(r&quot;(?-u:\\B)&quot;)</code> returns to the <code>regex &lt;1.8</code> behavior of\nnot compiling. (A <code>bytes::Regex</code> can still of course compile it.)</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1006\">#1006</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1006\">rust-lang/regex#1006</a>):\nFix a bug where <code>(?-u:\\B)</code> was allowed in Unicode regexes, and in turn could\nlead to match offsets that split a codepoint in <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>1.8.3 (2023-05-25)</h1>\n<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where the regex would report a\nmatch at every position even when it shouldn't. This could occur in a very\nsmall subset of regexes, usually an alternation of simple literals that\nhave particular properties. (See the issue linked below for a more precise\ndescription.)</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[BUG <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/999\">#999</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/999\">rust-lang/regex#999</a>):\nFix a bug where a match at every position is erroneously reported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>1.8.2 (2023-05-22)</h1>\n<p>This is a patch release that fixes a bug where regex compilation could panic\nin debug mode for regexes with large counted repetitions. For example,\n<code>a{2147483516}{2147483416}{5}</code> resulted in an integer overflow that wrapped\nin release mode but panicking in debug mode. Despite the unintended wrapping\narithmetic in release mode, it didn't cause any other logical bugs since the\nerrant code was for new analysis that wasn't used yet.</p>\n<p>Bug fixes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
