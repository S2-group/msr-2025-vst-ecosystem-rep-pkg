In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please merge this PR and migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot before then._\n\nDependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core][issues] repository.\n\n[Learn more about migrating to GitHub-native Dependabot][learn]\n\nPlease note that regular `@dependabot` commands do not work on this pull request.\n\n[dashboard]: https://app.dependabot.com/\n[dependabot_page]: https://github.com/joaoasrosa/azuredevops-pipeline-container/network/updates\n[issues]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/new?assignees=%40dependabot%2Fpreview-migration-reviewers&labels=E%3A+preview-migration&template=migration-issue.md\n[learn]: http://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/upgrading-from-dependabotcom-to-github-native-dependabot\n[new_syntax]: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates\n[org_secrets_url]: https://github.com/settings/secrets/dependabot\n[repo_secrets_url]: https://github.com/joaoasrosa/azuredevops-pipeline-container/settings/secrets/dependabot\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/joaoasrosa/azuredevops-pipeline-container/issues/3/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/joaoasrosa/azuredevops-pipeline-container/issues/3/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
