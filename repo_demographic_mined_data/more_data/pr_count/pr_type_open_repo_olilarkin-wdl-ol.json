These seem to work consistently/well with plugins using chunks but not as well when using MakePreset() or MakePresetFromNamedParams()\r\n\r\n- .vstpreset files can be imported/exported using Reaper's plugin preset utility menu, whereas they were greyed-out before. \r\n\r\n- .vstpreset files created in Sonar are compatible with ones created in Reaper and vice versa. I'm not sure about FLStudio as I only have a demo that is restricted in its ability to save..... .vstpreset files load well though. Other than SaviHost, those are the only hosts I've tested.\r\n\r\n- When kNumPrograms is greater than 1, the bank state is saved/recalled in both host project and .vstpreset files.\r\n\r\n- fixed an issue where the plugin would crash when cancelling a \"DumpPresets\" operation.\r\n\r\n- Modified IPlugChunks example project to demonstrate the improvements.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olilarkin/wdl-ol/issues/125/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olilarkin/wdl-ol/issues/125/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
