This PR adds a tiny utility function, called `pedalboard.time_stretch`, to expose Rubber Band's other useful bit of functionality: time stretching.\r\n\r\nNote that as time stretching changes the length of the audio, this functionality is exposed as a separate standalone function, rather than as a `Plugin` subclass, and as such **cannot be included in `Pedalboard` effects chains**. However, getting time stretching \"for free\" by adding ~128 lines of glue code and tests seems pretty worthwhile.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spotify/pedalboard/issues/249/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/spotify/pedalboard/issues/249/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
