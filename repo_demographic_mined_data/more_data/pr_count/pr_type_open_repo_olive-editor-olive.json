While I often don't create PRs for my own branches (though I probably should get into the habit), I'm doing so with this because it introduces so many sweeping changes, that it has almost certainly introduced bugs/crashes/incompatibilities that should be resolved before we merge to master. I've also been holding off on making too many changes to `master` since my focus was on this and I wanted to ensure a smooth merge.\r\n\r\nThe new additions in this branch are:\r\n\r\n- Channel swizzling (#1366). All types can be swizzled, including but not limited to floats (float/vec2/3/4), textures (RGBA), and audio (L/R). This allows for much greater flexibility as you can plug single-element values like floats into double-element inputs like position. You can also set which RGBA channels or audio channels a node will affect, and swap them all around at will.\r\n- Value auto-conversion (#1357). Much more comprehensive system to convert between value types. A sine generator (time + math set to sine) can now be plugged into an audio node to produce a tone. \r\n- Custom value types. Nodes can declare a custom type without having to add a whole new type throughout Olive. This will be useful for nodes that need specific data that can't be provided by out primitives.\r\n- Custom UI. Nodes can provide custom UI widgets for any input. This will greatly ease our ability to make various color grading-specific UIs like curves.\r\n- Math node overhaul and addition of many operations. For too long, this node has only had 5 operations. Now it also has min, max, clamp, floor, ceil, round, and abs. The trigonometry operations have also been merged in.\r\n- General improvements to code, usability, and performance.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this is still probably fairly unstable and not everything is complete, but I'm working on getting it up to speed.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olive-editor/olive/issues/2236/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olive-editor/olive/issues/2236/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
