Making the parent view the first responder fixes this problem. When you click on the opengl view, it becomes the first responder again and key events work.\r\n\r\n> The flagsChanged: method can be useful for detecting the pressing of modifier keys without any other key being pressed simultaneously. For example, if the user presses the Option key by itself, your responder object can detect this in its implementation of flagsChanged.\r\n[Source](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/HandlingKeyEvents/HandlingKeyEvents.html)\r\n\r\nI had to implement all key modifier flags on macOS for the fake/simulated keyUp event in `flagsChanged` to work properly:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nseventmodifierflags\r\n\r\nI have been testing this on Reaper, Ableton Live, Logic Pro and GarageBand.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/steinbergmedia/vstgui/issues/307/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/steinbergmedia/vstgui/issues/307/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
