This makes it significantly easier for CodeSee to introduce future improvements and fixes without requiring another PR like this.\n  - Improved Python support: The action now properly supports Python 3.11, and will continue to support new Python versions as they are released.\n\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel/issues/294/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel/issues/294/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
