This could cause problems later on in the execution of the code if the length of the chunks is larger than the user limit. This also ensures that the code is following the limitations set by the user. \r\n\r\nThis issue was fixed previously by this commit: https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/347538efbdc21b8df684ebd92d37400b3ce85d55\r\nThis fix adds code to pngpread.c and pngrutil.c to check the chunk length against the user limit; I just added the fix to the relevant files in your project's repo.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheTechnobear/SSP/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheTechnobear/SSP/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
