Now if the folder doesn't exist, the list is left empty. Empty list situation is already handled in the code, so the program doesn't crash anymore and asks the user to locate the VST folder.\r\n\r\nThis is a tiny but important change, because program crashing on first run may be a bit confusing and off-putting for new users.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/modavis-project/midiAuralizer/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/modavis-project/midiAuralizer/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
