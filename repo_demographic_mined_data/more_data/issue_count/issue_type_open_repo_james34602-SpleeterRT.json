I'm experimenting with a use case to create karaoke videos and one of the steps is separating the vocals from the audio tracks, in this case, only separating into 2 stems is needed (Vocals and Accompaniment). I'm trying to optimize the pre-trained models (Spleeter, for example) for the lowest possible latency, and I found your approach interesting. However, I don't have much knowledge in C and plugin creation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention :)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/james34602/SpleeterRT/issues/10/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/james34602/SpleeterRT/issues/10/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
