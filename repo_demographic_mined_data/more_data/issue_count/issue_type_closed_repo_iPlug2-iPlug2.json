Steps to reproduce:\r\n- Open Reaper project that comes with the example\r\n- Turn the toggle switch to deactivate the beat-synced LFO\r\n- Save the project and close it\r\n- Open the project and find that the toggle state was saved, but the beat-synced LFO is still active\r\n\r\nI found that the action function attached to the IVSlideSwitchControl is not called during startup. Setting it dirty will call it during startup but it then does not contain the saved control value. \r\n\r\nTested on Windows 11 and Reaper v6.68 with the included Reaper project loading the VST3 build. Visual Studio solution has not been touched other than updating it to the latest VS version.
