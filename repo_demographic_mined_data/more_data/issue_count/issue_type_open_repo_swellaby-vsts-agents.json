They also subsequently added features to the product (then VSTS now AzDO) to make it easy to dynamically install/use specific versions of tools from a pipeline via the tool installer framework and tasks.\r\n\r\nThose changes, plus the subsequent availability of Azure Pipelines for free for open source projects largely obviated our need for self-hosting agents of any kind.\r\n\r\nHowever... :smile: \r\nMicrosoft subsequently stopped distributing their own ~2 years ago and these days simply provide documentation so as to assist those needing to self-host with Docker can build their own image.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vsts-agent-docker\r\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-pipelines-vsts-agent\r\n\r\nAs such, if we _were_ to need custom Agent images, then we would have to roll our own and this repo seems like the place we'd want to do it. The question/challenge to that though is whether that's a real use case for us, current and/or a non-far fetched future possibility.\r\n\r\nGiven the current state of affairs, my sense is that this is a pretty unlikely hypothetical, and I am accordingly inclined to archive this repo (suppose we could always unarchive should the need arise)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/swellaby/vsts-agents/issues/5/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/swellaby/vsts-agents/issues/5/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
