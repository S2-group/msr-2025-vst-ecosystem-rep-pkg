I just discovered Aeolus and I love it. \r\n\r\nHowever I'm trying to use the VST3 it in music notation apps (Dorico) but when the app scans plug-ins, it is blocked by OS Security.\r\n\r\nUsually I can open System Preferences / Security and then click \"open anyway\". That option is given, but it doesn't work. \r\n\r\nI have tried with older versions of Aeolus.vst3. No luck. \r\n\r\nI have also tried following these instructions (from the Dorico team). No luck.\r\n\r\n>  In a Terminal window, type:\r\n> \r\n> sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine\r\n> \r\n> followed by a space. Don\u2019t press Return!\r\n> \r\n> Then drag the plug-in onto the Terminal window. Now press Return.\r\n> \r\n> You will asked to type in your admin user password.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that my older MacBook Pro (2014) running Big Sur could not open Aeolus Standalone 0.2.0 but **does** open earlier versions. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help with this!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Archie3d/aeolus_plugin/issues/24/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Archie3d/aeolus_plugin/issues/24/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
