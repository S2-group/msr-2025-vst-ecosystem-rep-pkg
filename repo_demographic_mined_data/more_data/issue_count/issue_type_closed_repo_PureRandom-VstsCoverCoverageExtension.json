I receive an error when I use the Publish Test Results task:\r\n\r\n ##[warning]Failed to publish test results: Invalid file format.\r\n\r\nI have tried all the different formats that can be outputted by dotcover- but it seems to me that none of the formats can be used.\r\n\r\nSo, how can either one of the formats that is outputed by dotcover be used in VSTS for reporting code coverage.  Alternatively, are there any converters that can be used to provide the same functionality?\r\n\r\nregards", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PureRandom/VstsCoverCoverageExtension/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PureRandom/VstsCoverCoverageExtension/issues/6/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
