I found that my plugin and the version of this plugin that I downloaded both failed to open in Ableton (on Mac). It appears that the issue is what is described [here](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/236#issuecomment-499455351), when I commented out this in my plugin I was able to load it in Ableton:\r\n```\r\nconst DEFAULT_INPUT_CHANNELS: u32 = 0;\r\nconst DEFAULT_OUTPUT_CHANNELS: u32 = 0;\r\n```\r\n(I guess those are specifying that this is a \"non-audio\" plugin and Ableton doesn't want to load non-audio VST3 plugins?)\r\n\r\nSo I don't know what a good solution would be to allow (new) released versions of this plugin to be able to run on Ableton since I think there are downsides to that hacky commenting-out solution (eg Ableton then seemed to show some audio-related GUI in its panel for the plugin whereas I don't think it typically does that for non-audio plugins)?\r\n\r\nFwiw I've successfully run VST2 MIDI effect (non-audio) plugins in Ableton (that I created using JUCE) but I guess this is Ableton + VST3-specific", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AlexW00/clockwork/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AlexW00/clockwork/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
