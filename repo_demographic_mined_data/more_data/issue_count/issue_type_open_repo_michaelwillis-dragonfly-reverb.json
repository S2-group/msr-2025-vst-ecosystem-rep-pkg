The easiest way to reproduce this glitch is with the following configuration:\r\n\r\nSize: 60m\r\nDecay: 0.1ms (this is to see the glitch visually on the decaymeter)\r\nHigh Mult: 0.2x\r\nHigh Cross: 16000Hz (This one is important for actually getting the wall of sound)\r\n\r\nI've also discovered that if there is a cancellation of sound, upon initialising the plugin, the cancellation of sound gives way to the wall of noise.\r\n\r\nThe attached video demonstrates this glitch pretty well.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/michaelwillis/dragonfly-reverb/assets/125376397/54b31a99-8b5d-46e1-98a3-fa1ea4cd79b3\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/michaelwillis/dragonfly-reverb/issues/162/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/michaelwillis/dragonfly-reverb/issues/162/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
