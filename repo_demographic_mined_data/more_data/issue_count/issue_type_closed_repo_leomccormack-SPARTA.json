The tooling we use to automatically download and install (AutoPkg, Munki, Jamf Pro) needs a way to know that the version has been updated, and to install that latest version. One common way is looking at package receipts for this. \r\n\r\nWould it be possible for you to bump the package receipt version number when you release a new version so that they match? Currently the package receipt is on version 1.0 but the actual release number is 1.6.2 \r\n\r\n` pkg-ref id=\"com.sparta.pkg.\" version=\"1.0\" auth=\"Root\"` would become  `pkg-ref id=\"com.sparta.pkg.\" version=\"1.6.2\" auth=\"Root\"`\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration, and please let me know if you want any further clarification \r\n\r\nPaul", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/66/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leomccormack/SPARTA/issues/66/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
