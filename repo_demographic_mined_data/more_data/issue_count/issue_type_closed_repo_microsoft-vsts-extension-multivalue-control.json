Tried re-adding a field again, did not do anything. Tried even reinstalling the extension in the Organization -- but that didn't work.\r\n\r\nDid I check 'New Boards Hubs' setting under Preview feature unde rUser Settings?\r\nYes, I did. It was OFF for me. However, for couple of other folks it was ON and even after changing to OFF no success.\r\nAny ideas/advices?\r\n\r\n![1_ADO_multi_value](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-multivalue-control/assets/91320655/613e9f95-4b16-42b7-ba17-b9f512fd3b5c)\r\n![2_ADO_multi_value](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-multivalue-control/assets/91320655/2e8b6dfe-e876-4049-9935-32d0f6f9039f)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vsts-extension-multivalue-control/issues/268/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vsts-extension-multivalue-control/issues/268/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
