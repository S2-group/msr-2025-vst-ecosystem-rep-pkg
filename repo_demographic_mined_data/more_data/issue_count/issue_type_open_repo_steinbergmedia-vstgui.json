However, we design a view which is used to display frequency spectrum for every 2 frames of input audio. That is to say, the view will refresh very high. While using the latest version of vstgui (4.12), we found the view will flicker from time to time especially run on vst3plugintesthost 64bit.\r\nI don't know what the problem is. Finally, we switched to a commit: 03b61ef3f85fc8d58fd47d68c38ca574a9dbd44d (2021/1/14 23:05:16\uff0c ver:4.10)\uff0c and the problem was gone. \r\nWe had tried 4.11, the is same as 4.12.\r\nDo you know what the question?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/steinbergmedia/vstgui/issues/293/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/steinbergmedia/vstgui/issues/293/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
