Please note that this issue is just intended as a friendly reminder and the PR as a possible starting point for getting your code running on Node.js 10.\n\n<details>\n<summary>More information on this issue</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper has checked the `engines` key in any `package.json` file, the `.nvmrc` file, and the `.travis.yml` file, if present.\n- `engines` was only updated if it defined a single version, not a range.\n- `.nvmrc` was updated to Node.js 10\n- `.travis.yml` was only changed if there was a root-level `node_js` that didn\u2019t already include Node.js 10, such as `node` or `lts/*`. In this case, the new version was appended to the list. We didn\u2019t touch job or matrix configurations because these tend to be quite specific and complex, and it\u2019s difficult to infer what the intentions were.\n\nFor many simpler `.travis.yml` configurations, this PR should suffice as-is, but depending on what you\u2019re doing it may require additional work or may not be applicable at all. We\u2019re also aware that you may have good reasons to not update to Node.js 10, which is why this was sent as an issue and not a pull request. Feel free to delete it without comment, I\u2019m a humble robot and won\u2019t feel rejected :robot:\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html).
