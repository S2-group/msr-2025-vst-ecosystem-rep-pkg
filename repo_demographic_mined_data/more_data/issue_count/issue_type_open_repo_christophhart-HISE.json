I tested with the consts replaced by magic numbers (int) and the result is the same.\r\n\r\nI have the \"Enable global preprocessor\" in settings disabled, but I have #on at the beginning of my script.\r\n\r\nI'm flagging it as breaking because it works in HISE, compiles successfully and then the VSTi won't load. \r\n\r\nIt took me a bit to manually go through every change from a previous commit that worked and nail it down to the preprocessor.
