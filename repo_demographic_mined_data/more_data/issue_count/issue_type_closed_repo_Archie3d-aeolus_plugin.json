When I use Aeolus plugin as vst3 instrument in daw(reaper), the reverb and output volume go up max immediately at some points. It happens at the start and the end of playback for sure, but occasionally in the middle of playback. I can't figure out the exact condition of this event. But it happens repeatedly.\r\n\r\nI am using intel i7-9700, 24gb ram pc and windows 11. I tested it with another midi file on other daws like Cakewalk by Bandlab, Tracktion Waveform. I could find out it happens on them too. \r\n\r\nI recorded a quick demonstration here.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2EGvRaniVc\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Archie3d/aeolus_plugin/issues/21/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Archie3d/aeolus_plugin/issues/21/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
