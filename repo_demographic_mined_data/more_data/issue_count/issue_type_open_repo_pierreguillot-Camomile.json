I have had the VST files pop up under MacOS' security wall when trying to \"open\" them and even after allowing them to be opened they still refuse to show up in a DAW, even when both in the Plugins>VST3 & AU folders and selected a desktop folder as a second source. \r\n\r\nLIRA-8 is actually accessible on its own via PD but I'm completely stumped as to where the issue is when it comes to opening in Ableton 11. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pierreguillot/Camomile/issues/316/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pierreguillot/Camomile/issues/316/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
