All the other types that are envolve in this scenario, like Epic, User Story and some custom types, I was able to automatize the job of moving them between States.\r\n\r\nBut, there's one board with some swimlanes: for this specific point, I need to, through Power Automate, be able to move a item between board columns and in the correct swimlane. But, unfortunately the Board Column is read only for default.\r\n\r\nAfter some given context, then become the question: considering that everything listed in a type (like User story) is exposed to Power Automate, there is any plans to include any field that goes through this and allow to change the item between columns? I look at User Story fields exposed, but I wasn't able to find anything that allow me to change the column, just the regular ones.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\n\r\nJuliano", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreifel/Board-Group/issues/45/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ostreifel/Board-Group/issues/45/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
