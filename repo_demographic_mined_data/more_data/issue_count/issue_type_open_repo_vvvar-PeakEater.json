Load the plugin and go into phase display mode\r\n2. By changing the oversampling factor, pay attention to the phase response of the high frequencies\r\n3. By clipping the signal you can see that the phase shift is amplified\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\nLinear phase of the whole frequency response at any clipping level with any oversampling factor.\r\n\r\nDesktop:\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Plugin format VST3\r\n - Version 0.8.2\r\n\r\nDAW:\r\n - Name: PluginDoctor, Studio One, Bertom EQ Curve Analyzer\r\n - Version 1.4.1, 6.2.0, 2.0.0 respectively\r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\nThis does not affect the sound quality much, but in some cases may result in a noticeable reduction or enhancement of high frequencies.. In the screenshots x2 and x32 oversampling is used, but in one form or another phase shifts are present in all its factors.\r\n![003](https://github.com/vvvar/PeakEater/assets/127718490/9c14e103-7151-4e38-8922-6e568d392ee5)\r\n![002](https://github.com/vvvar/PeakEater/assets/127718490/651e7794-8f6d-4c7d-a7ad-3fd9cecf245a)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vvvar/PeakEater/issues/102/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vvvar/PeakEater/issues/102/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
