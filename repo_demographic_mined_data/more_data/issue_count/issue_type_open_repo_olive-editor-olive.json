To be clear it is not Olive that is crashing, but Olive that is making **my whole computer shut down** toward the end of the export, which then has to be rebooted manually.\r\n\r\nSeems like processor is maxed out before the RAM in this process. Are my specs too low to export a 5 min video in Olive?\r\n\r\nPossibly linked to #2153?\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Drag and drop videos in a project sequence to be about 5 min long\r\n2. Ctrl+M and export with default options\r\n3. Wait until the end, and experience a PC shut down\r\n\r\n<details><summary><strong>Crash Report</strong></summary><pre><code>\r\n\r\n<!-- You should have received a crash report from Olive to paste here. -->\r\n\r\n</code></pre></details>\r\n\r\nI am not able to find a crash report, because my PC is forced shut down along with Olive, which prevents my access to any crash report (I think? It does not appear in the same folder as the Olive file/video and could not find a crash report folder in `C:\\Program Files\\Olive`).\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\n\r\nDon't remember having this problem with the old version (i.e., the version whose files are not compatible with the new version anymore).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olive-editor/olive/issues/2283/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olive-editor/olive/issues/2283/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
