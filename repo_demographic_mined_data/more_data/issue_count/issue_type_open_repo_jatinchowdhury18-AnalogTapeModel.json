Please describe.**\r\nThe saturation is great, but certain parameters could benefit from a higher oversampling setting to fight aliasing in the signal.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to have higher oversampling options within the plugin (x32, x64 or even higher) specially for rendering.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis plugin might be the most convincing tape emulation I've heard, and I feel that with a little more oversampling It could become almost indistinguishable from the real, modeled tape machine. I don't know how hard this would be to implement, so I apologize in advance In case It's too much to ask. I don't want to be entitled or unreasonable. \r\n\r\nThank you for all you do.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel/issues/308/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel/issues/308/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
