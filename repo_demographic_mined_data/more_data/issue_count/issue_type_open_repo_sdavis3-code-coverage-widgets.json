It helps our managers to get all data on one dashboard. Thanks!\r\n\r\nWe have a strange request. Currently, we use several projects in the ADO instance, and historically they are divided not logically. One team has a project with Dashboards but without pipelines. They keep their pipeline in another project. And the current version of the widget is project-based (list the pipelines from the same dashboard project). Is it possible to add a feature that will allow dashboard owners to choose from which project builds need to be shown?
