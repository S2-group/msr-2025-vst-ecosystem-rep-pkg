I'm using Wohlstand's OPL3 Bank Editor to view and create Adlib patches from/for Sierra SCI adventure games which use a very similar format to Adlib's BNK format. However, Sierra SCI games do not support rhythm banks for OPL2. Only melodic. While I'm composing for a custom SCI game or previewing Adlib music tracks from existing SCI games with SCI Companion or SCI Viewer, there is MIDI data used for OPL2 on channel 10 but it's meant to reference one of the standard melodic patches (or many melodic patches, one at a time via MIDI program change commands) and not a rhythm patch. If there was an option to be able to change any MIDI channel from rhythm to melodic and vice versa that would solve my issue.\r\n\r\nMy request/suggestion is to keep the default setting as rhythm for channel 10, but allow the user to change it for strange cases like mine. Or perhaps compatibility with some other MIDI standard that uses percussion on a channel other than 10 (such as XG or Base MIDI or something?). If this is possible to implement I'd be tremendously grateful!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/94/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/94/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
