There is even a comment saying, \"//process events.. only midi note on and note off?\".\r\n\r\nThis is extremely limiting considering Steinberg has officially discontinued VST2 and you cannot acquire the VST 2 API from them, so all new plugins should be VST3.\r\n\r\nWhen digging deeper I discovered that the IPlug core wasn't written to handle MIDI controllers from VST3. Generally these seem to be handled from a \"controller\" class that is separate from the \"audio effect\" class (enumerated as kVstAudioEffectClass and kVstComponentControllerClass). The \"controller\" class is not implemented in IPlug.\r\n\r\nApparently in VST3 the MIDI messages for pitch bend, control messages, etc must be mapped to a parameter with its own parameter ID, so some rewrites to IPlug are required to remedy this issue.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olilarkin/wdl-ol/issues/126/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/olilarkin/wdl-ol/issues/126/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
