While it does work for users who are still using v3.0 of Load Impact. Any new users are not able to start tests in v4.0 of Load Impact.  For example, the endpoints to list and start tests have changed:\r\n- [List Tests](http://developers.loadimpact.com/#operation/List%20tests)\r\n- [Start Tests](http://developers.loadimpact.com/#operation/Start%20test-run)\r\n\r\nIt worth noting that, [k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6), the open source load generator/CLI that v4.0 is built around can be integrated directly into Azure DevOps as described [here](https://support.loadimpact.com/4.0/integrations/azure-devops-integration/).  However, I think an extension like this can be handy for users of Azure DevOps, to simplify their ability to launch tests. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/julienstroheker/loadimpact-vsts-extension/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/julienstroheker/loadimpact-vsts-extension/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
