I've been referenced to this repo by someone stating that synth2 would be aiming for patch compatibility with Ichiro Toda - Synth1's. Effectively making this synthesizer a Synth1 clone of sorts. \r\n\r\nI have however not found anything about the goals of this synthesizer itself so I am rather curious if you're able to answer anything about the goals of synth2. Is it going to be a synth primarily used to learn Dplug? A full backwards compatible synth1 clone? Something else?, etc. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nMetalMaxMX.
