When a work item is viewed, the extension calculates the WSJF value and writes it to the result field, which was previously empty. This changes the work item and the user sees this status change on the additional asterisk. If the user wants to leave the page, he will be stopped and asked whether he wants to \"discard changes\" or \"save changes\".\r\n\r\nSuggestion for improvement: the extension should not change the WSJF value for empty input fields\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/AzureDevOps-WSJF-Extension/issues/53/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/AzureDevOps-WSJF-Extension/issues/53/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
