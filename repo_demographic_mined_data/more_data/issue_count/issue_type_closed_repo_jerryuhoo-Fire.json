This software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information. \r\n\r\nAs someone suggested I tried downloading it with Safari instead of FireFox but alas. I'm using FL Studio 20, I don't have issues with other plugins so I don't think it's an FL issue. I've checked my system settings to allow from trusted developers as well as the App Store but it doesn't let me allow this plugin specifically like it would normally with an unverified app (I suppose because it is not an 'app' to the system unless it's loaded into the FL Wrapper).\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me fix or circumvent this please? I saw the plugin in a video and it looks reaally good so I would be very thankful!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jerryuhoo/Fire/issues/58/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jerryuhoo/Fire/issues/58/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
