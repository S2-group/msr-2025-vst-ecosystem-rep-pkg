> Bogdan Andrei, Mauricio Verano Merino, Ivano Malavolta. The Ecosystem of Open-Source Music Production Software – A Mining Study on the Development Practices of VST Plugins on GitHub. Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025).

In this study we shed light on a unique and interdisciplinary domain, where music, technology, and human creativity intersect: music production software. Today _software_ technologies are the predominant means of music production, with a vibrant ecosystem for commercial and open-source products.

In this work we target VST plugins, the de-facto standard for developing and prototyping music production software. We analyze 15,847 data points over 299 GitHub repositories containing VST plugins. Our results include a systematic quantification of the (i) characteristics of open-source VST projects in terms of, e.g., duration, size, contributors, stars/watchers, licensing, (ii) most used technologies for developing VST plugins, and (iii) code quality and testing practices in VST projects.

Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the practice in VST plugins development, highlighting successful projects, opportunities for improvement, and future research directions for software engineering researchers.

## Overview of the replication package
This replication package is structured as follows:

    |--- Quantitative analysis/	The scripts utilized and the data extracted during the analysis.
    |--- Repositories data/		The scripts utilized and the data extracted during the mining process of VST Plugins repositories on GitHub.
 
Each of the folders listed above are described in details in the remaining of this readme.

### Quantitative analysis

    |--- Figures                                       Contains the figures outputted from the "quantitative_analysis_script.py" Python script.
    |--- Output CSVs                                   Contains additional CSVs files outputted from the "quantitative_analysis_script.py" Python script, that were utilized at a later stage for this study.
    |--- Descriptive Statistics.csv                    The descriptive statistics of the mined repositories.
    |--- rq1.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ1.
    |--- rq2.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ2.
    |--- rq3.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ3.
