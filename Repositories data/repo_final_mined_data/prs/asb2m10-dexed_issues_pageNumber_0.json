"User story: As a user, I would like to put voice data into my MIDI track that is being played by Dexed in a DAW (the one that contains the notes to be played). When playing MIDI from the track, the voice data from the sysex should be loaded into the Dexed VST. My use case i that I would like to script loading voice data into Dexed inside Reaper.\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems that Dexed only accepts sysex over the MIDI device set under PARM as \"MIDI In\".\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it would also accept sysex coming in from the MIDI track that is being played. Just like it plays MIDI notes, it should also load MIDI sysex. This way, MIDI notes and MIDI sysex could be saved together on the same track in the DAW. This would allow to automate (by scripting the DAW) the setup of multiple layers (tracks) in TX816 style.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/assets/2480569/6a882951-76d4-4e92-9ec0-f0ad4e4360e6)\r\n\r\nIn the picture, each of the tracks TG1...TG8 contains a sysex (\"SYX\") with the voice data that should be played by the Dexed instance that is on the respective track.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nhttps://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/discussions/352", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/401/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/401/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/400", "id": 2017264181, "node_id": "I_kwDOAOR7V854PQI1", "number": 400, "title": "Expose .syx files as JSON or vstpreset?", "user": {"login": "turian", "id": 65918, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65918?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian", "html_url": "https://github.com/turian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-11-29T19:21:33Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-29T19:21:33Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "There are many .syx files floating around, but the file format is hard to understand.

I can't figure out, how pitch bend should work. My expectation was, that if you send 2 different pitch bend values to 2 different channels, they will be independent from each other. This kind of approach works on Surge XT, and with chipsynths from Plogue. However, this doesn't work with Dexed - pitch bend seems to be global. Example code, how i use Dexed in Supercollider:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// 1. define synthdef\r\n(\r\nSynthDef(\\vst_plugin, {|out, gate = 1|\r\n\tvar sig = VSTPlugin.ar(numOut: 2);\r\n\tOut.ar(out, sig);\r\n}).add;\r\n)\r\n\r\n// 2. init synth\r\na = Synth(\\vst_plugin);\r\n\r\n// 3. init vst plugin controller\r\nc.open(\"Dexed.vst3\");\r\n\r\n// 4. play notes\r\n(\r\np = Pbind(\r\n\t\\type, \\vst_midi,\r\n\t\\vst, c,\r\n\t\\midinote, Pseq([60]),\r\n\t\\chan, 3,\r\n\t\\dur, Pseq([1]),\r\n\t\\amp, 1.0\r\n);\r\n\r\nq = Pbind(\r\n\t\\type, \\vst_midi,\r\n\t\\vst, c,\r\n\t\\midicmd, \\bend,\r\n\t\\val, Pseq([8192]), // def 8192, min 0, max 16383\r\n\t\\chan, 3,\r\n\t\\dur, Pseq([1]),\r\n);\r\n\r\nt = Pbind(\r\n\t\\type, \\vst_midi,\r\n\t\\vst, c,\r\n\t\\midinote,

file: Exec format error\r\n```\r\n\r\nFortunately, it is still possible to build Projucer from source, and I was able to get Dexed built and working by replacing ./assets/JUCE/Projucer with the recompiled binary. So for the complete build process:\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/asb2m10/dexed\r\ncd dexed\r\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\r\n./scripts/get_juce.sh\r\n\r\ncd ..\r\ngit clone https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE\r\ncd JUCE\r\ncmake . -B cmake-build -DJUCE_BUILD_EXTRAS=ON  # takes a long time\r\ncmake --build cmake-build --target Projucer    # takes a very long time\r\ncp cmake-build/extras/Projucer/Projucer_artefacts/Projucer ../dexed/assets/JUCE/Projucer   # overwrites x86 Projucer binary\r\n\r\ncd ..\r\ncd dexed\r\n./scripts/projuce.sh  # should actually work now\r\n./scripts/build-lin.sh\r\n```\r\nAnd if all goes well, a working binary should be dropped in `Builds/Linux/build/Dexed`.\r\n\r\nIt seems that nothing about support for Linux on ARM here is actually broken, and it's just the build system not making any attempt to detect or work with non-x86 architectures. Once I'd stumbled my way into this solution, I was able to compile a working binary of Dexed on my Pinebook Pro running Manjaro, and it works excellently connected to my keyboard via USB with Pipewire (emulating JACK) as the audio backend. Since there are a lot of ARM devices like this with favorable characteristics for audio work - especially the Raspberry Pi series, which see a lot of artistic use - I think it would be worth providing documentation to build Dexed on other architectures besides just x86. I opened an issue instead of making a pull request, though, because I have never encountered Juce before and have no idea what the most appropriate way to streamline the build process here would be. This is a solution that works, but it compiles a huge amount of extra code that isn't really needed, so it would be great if there were a way to avoid having to completely rebuild Juce and Projucer. \r\n\r\nAt the very least, my hope is that this issue will be found by web searches for this problem when people who are relatively new to Linux try to build Dexed on their Raspberry Pi, just to us something to work with, but I do think that it would be really helpful and worthwhile for someone familiar with this build system to come up with a cleaner solution.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/305/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/305/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/302", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/302/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/302/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/302/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/302", "id": 971874434, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU5NzE4NzQ0MzQ=", "number": 302, "title": "Can't send patches/cartridges in dexed, but can in Sysex Librarian", "user": {"login": "zmichels", "id": 8769619, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg3Njk2MTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8769619?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels", "html_url": "https://github.com/zmichels", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zmichels/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-08-16T15:49:38Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-16T15:50:22Z", "closed_at": "2021-08-16T15:50:22Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am new to dexed, and it is awesome!\r\n\r\nI recently got a Korg OpSix FM synth, and I have seen videos of folks sending DX7 cartridges to it via Sysex over midi with Dexed.
