A great addition to (custom) wavetables, that have their own pro's and con's (e.g. finding/selecting/building them).\r\n\r\nSurge already has several (many!) great oscillator shaping functions. Surge also already has the slider controls to control the shaping amount. And these slider are also a modulation targets. All great! But it could be even better!\r\n\r\nEven some extra \"simple\" squeeze/stretch transformations in the Horizontal (Time) and Vertical (Amplitude) domain are great.\r\n\r\nMaybe add extra shape distortion curves/functions as a modulator for the oscillator shape in time and/or amplitude domain. Or even allow custom shapes (via editor or import). Or even dynamically shapeable shaping shapes....\r\n\r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\nOf course there are infinite possibilities in Wave shaping shapes and functions. Even when just applying this to the amplitude domain. Sort of companding/distortion of the amplitude (vertical) domain of the wave shape. A common wave shaping/distortion function). Already implemented in Surge in some forms / signal path stages.\r\n\r\nBut of course this can also be applied to the time (horizontal) domain. Surge already offers this in some form too. With the right shape/function you can achive something \"simple\" as \"PWM\" of say an symmetric SAW into a asymetric SAW. By companding/distoring over the time domain. To visualize: where the zero crossing is shift left, compressing anything left of the zero crossing, expanding anything to the right.\r\n\r\nSince the time domain is revlevant for both frequency and phase, you could als modulate phase to distort/shape a wave. Some words on that below in the \"special\" bit on FM/PM/PD.\r\n\r\nIn general, you can apply any wave shaping curve at any amount to the time and/or amplitude domain of the oscillator wave shape. Added control over the Oscillator Shape Wave Shaping curve (in the Oscillator section) would be great to. Some edit functions would be tops. But some clever presets would be great too. Or some \"wavetable\" like option, where you can morph between fixed shapes?\r\n\r\nRandom link to amplitude shaping\r\n\r\nhttps://www.testandmeasurementtips.com/basics-of-amplitude-distortion-faq/\r\nSome \"special\" waveshaping functions that might deserve a seperate feature request: Phase Distortion\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_distortion_synthesis\r\nPeavy/Casio Phase Distortion.\r\n\r\n\"non-cyclic\" shaping functions\r\nhttps://theproaudiofiles.com/phase-distortion-synthesis/\r\nYamaha \"FM\" phase distortion wave shaping\r\n\r\nphase modulating a 0 Hz carrier as offered by e.g. Yamaha SY77/99.\r\n16 operator/modulator \"cyclic\" operator/modulator waveshapes\r\nThere have been some Korg implementations of FM/PM/PD too: Variable Phase Modulation (e.g. Prophecy, Z1).

I noticed that OverlayWrappers were not set to opaque. This meant that everything that partially intersected with some OverlayWrappers would get repainted at the same rate that the (non-opaque?) children get repainted. This is a big CPU hit as like 10+ sliders get repainted at 60 FPS.

This is adressed by #6634.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that when neither window is un-pinned, the tearout windows are always-behind the main Surge UI window. Obviously window focus usually determines which window goes on top. \r\nThis is especially annoying because it means pressing the tear-out button apparently just makes the window in question dissappear. At which point one has to move the main UI out of the way to be able to access the pin button so the tearout can go on top. Not very useful. \r\n\r\nIn less problematic but probably related news, both windows pinned also doesn't correctly follow the last-focused-window-on-top paradigm.

probably, but this was my path:\r\n\r\n1. Selected a (somewhat flakey) external usb device in options.\r\n2. Quit.\r\n3. Unplugged from external audio jack (not device itself) -- perhaps this is what created bad state? \r\n4.

Removing that connection and restarting and changing sound options in system prferences did not fix.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\n\r\n I was able to fix by going into

It seemed first time like a takeover issue, but it's basically just this: no automation \"actual\" value, nor GUI knobs on host side refresh to their real value when you load a new preset. The big impact on my workflow is: I have a default preset saved for SurgeXT in Ableton Live. Surge's 8 macro knobs are made to show up as first 8 controls on live's little plugin GUI at bottom of the screen (Opening VST controls with [>] button on it and pressing Configure just to move Surge's controls to show up on Push 2's knobs. When you load a new preset in Surge, Live's GUI \"Macro1..8\" controls stay greyed at previous presets' last value and instantly jump there when you start to move given Push knobs. They are rotary encoders showing actual values on screen. This behavior completely destroys this simple use case.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\nVersion: Surge XT 1.1.1.ecf7fe6\r\nBuild: 2022-08-25 @ 21:56:20 on 'WIN-KDGQ3UVP6AT/pipeline' with 'MSVC-19.29.30146.0' using JUCE 6.1.6\r\nSystem: Windows 64-bit VST3 on Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4150 CPU @ 3.50GHz (Windows 10)\r\nHost: Ableton Live 11 @ 44.1 kHz\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nAbleton live 11, change to midi clip view on Surge's track (Shift+Tab from device view), switch to envelopes view (two dots connected backslash form, Alt+2), move any of Surge's controls (one is enough), switch/load preset in Surge, watch that parameter changing on Surge's GUI and not changing on Live's GUI.\r\nMy use case: Switch to Device view (Shift+Tab from Clip view), open Surge's extended view on it with little triangle button pointing down/right. Press Configure button, it stays active. Move any controls on Surge GUI, watch them appearing on Live's Device view, Switch off \"Configure\" mode, and load a new preset in Surge. None of them will move. When you move any of them, their corresponding controls on Surge will jump to that wrong value first.\r\n\r\n1. Go to '...'\r\n2. Click on '...'\r\n3. Scroll down to '...'\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nPlease give the host your controls new state when required! Especially on preset load.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q0YGVp2dTx6391n3MdCbsGKhF3zkZjQw?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Host: Ableton Live 11\r\n - Version: 11\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nPush2's knobs are practically unusable after Surge preset load (even when loading partial presets with that hamburger menu like button)\r\n\r\nEdit: typo\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6607/reactions", "total_count":

Please describe!**\r\n\r\nI am frustrated when I am not sure which scene I am in or which oscillator I have selected if I am in another section of the synth.\r\nWhile using Surge I would very much like the alt + s shortcuts for scenes. Alt + 1/2/3 for oscillators. used speech synthesis to tell what the status of the selection is.\r\nAlt + s scene 1 / scene2. Alt + 1/2/3 changes the oscillator. If you are in another section like LFO I don't know after minutes if I am in one scene or another. Also for the oscillator.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful while working if the screen reader would announce the selected scene or oscillator via the shortcuts.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\n\r\nIf it is easier to develop. For shortcuts, the Windows sapi 5 system speech is also good. More useful if the screen reader announced it.\r\nThank you!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6591/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

This wasn't there before. I would rather navigate to the menu item, hear its name and then expand it with arrow right. This is much better. Here my version:\r\nVersion: Surge XT 1.1.1.ecf7fe6\r\nBuild: 2022-08-25 @ 21:56:36 on 'Mac-1661463371316.local/pipeline' with 'AppleClang-13.0.0.13000029' using JUCE 6.1.6\r\nSystem: macOS 64-bit Standalone on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1068NG7 CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\nSample Rate: 44.1 kHz\r\nMy OS version is Mac OS 12.5.1.\r\nTo reproduce the behavior, you can do the following:\r\n1. Fire up Voiceover screen reader with Cmd + F5\r\n2. 2. Navigate for instance to the main menu and open it.\r\n3. What happens is: The item \"patch defaults\" already gets expanded and the first menu item is read.\r\n4.
