VST3, AU, CLAP]\r\n* Bitness: [64-bit]\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Add Surge as VST2 plugin. \r\n2. Open Filter Analysis window\r\n3. Move the point to apply cutoff filter\r\n4. Observe that filter is working, but the host doesn't see the VST params are changed \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nWe should see the VST params of filter are also changed in the host so that we can control automation correctly, for example.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n![GIF Recording 2023-06-05 at 7 33 04

more alertOkCancels to the custom overlay and adding utility for the code to draw the window as discussed in the above pull request. Having the Alert and MiniEdit overlays use this - though subsequently other overlays may use this as well. My preference for the implementation of this is as a utility method, but I'm happy to add an abstraction layer instead if you prefer. We could also add more common code for buttons etc to this in the next PRs.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n1. Thoughts on standardizing between \"Ok\"/\"Cancel\" and \"Yes\"/\"No\" for these? This PR uses only the former - if we want to definitely allow both, I'll update this PR. \r\n2. Could you point me to how to test all the changes for this? I love this synth but I am new to it so I've never used the functionality this PR edits. \r\n\r\nAdditionally - I'll be travelling starting tomorrow mid-day Seattle/US time and will be back Monday. So it will be difficult for me to contribute during this time. Next week however, I should be able to continue work on this and look at some of the short circuit work pointed to in discord.

[64-bit]\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Right click on the Attack controller in the Filter EG section and learn from MIDI controller.\r\n2. On Nektar Impact LX49+, use the first slider (called attack)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nA expect the slider to travel from bottom to top in correspondence to the controller.  It does not.  It only moves 1 bit, from 0 to 1.  I have confirmed the controller itself is fine as my DAW (Renoise) can see full 128 bit resolution coming from the same physical control.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7010/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7010/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7009", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7009/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7009/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7009/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7009", "id": 1692836269, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes5k5qGt", "number": 7009, "title": "String Excitation using FM source", "user": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1064039352, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDY0MDM5MzUy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Feature%20Request", "name": "Feature Request", "color": "a2eeef", "default": false, "description": "New feature request"}, {"id": 1178867708, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMTc4ODY3NzA4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/DSP", "name": "DSP", "color": "e881ef", "default": false, "description": "Issues and feature requests related to sound generation in the synth"}, {"id": 1510702094, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNTEwNzAyMDk0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Oscillator", "name": "Oscillator", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Features or additions to the oscillator section"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/28", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28/labels", "id": 8227677, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCOvoes4AfYtd", "number": 28, "title": "Surge XT 1.x", "description": "Things we could do in the 1.x family but didn't make 1.2 or 1.3", "creator": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 60, "closed_issues": 3, "state": "open", "created_at": "2022-07-22T12:11:50Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-04T08:57:18Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2023-05-02T17:47:05Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-22T08:21:59Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Just joined the monthly Linnstrument zoom call\r\n\r\nIdea came up which was: can we use other oscillators as a string exciter\r\n\r\nThe way to do this is to add two more exciter modes\r\n\r\n1.

I was advised by a user on the Discord to try checking constant rate and using logarithmic curve shape, since in their testing at least, this was a bit better. However, all settings will still produce a slide. Furthermore very large note jumps (a few octaves or more), have longer slides with constant rate checked than unchecked, even if the portamento time is kept at 0ms.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought this was a design limitation of the oscillators, and for string and modern types this indeed seems to be the case as they will quickly ramp/slide when performing pitch change by any means. However all other osc types can be forced into extreme, non-ramped pitch changes with lfos, or modulation from CC (if midi smoothing is disabled), so most oscs seem capable of instant portamento.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6984/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6984/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6983", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6983/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6983/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6983/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6983", "id": 1680057292, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes5kI6PM", "number": 6983, "title": "The tuning problem: XT2 plans", "user": {"login": "Andreya-Autumn", "id": 105538426, "node_id": "U_kgDOBkpjeg", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105538426?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn", "html_url": "https://github.com/Andreya-Autumn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Andreya-Autumn/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1505910927, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNTA1OTEwOTI3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Tuning", "name": "Tuning", "color": "027039", "default": false, "description": "Non-standard tuning extensions"}, {"id": 2877964229, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyODc3OTY0MjI5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Discussion", "name": "Discussion", "color": "d0c509", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/23", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/23", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/23/labels", "id": 6346441, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjM0NjQ0MQ==", "number": 23, "title": "Surge XT 2.0", "description": "Next level Surge!\r\n\r\nThis milestone presents a solid book of work we have slated for the next major Surge XT release, after the initial one we have released in Jan 2022.

Presently, Surge will use one out of these two behaviors across the board always, user selectable as \"Apply tuning at MIDI input\" vs. \"Apply tuning after modulation\".\r\n\r\nFor the user this basically translates into: \"pitch parameters/modulations set constant offsets which apply equally to all notes\" vs: \"pitch parameters/modulations set offsets which cleverly follow the loaded scale\". No difference at all while you stay in 12-equal, but any other scale this makes a big difference.\r\n\r\nThere is also the question of whether frequency offsets are resolved in log2-space (jives well with human musical perception, creates consistent harmonic relations, or linear space (for inharmonic bell-like funtimes etc), which we also want to support.\r\n\r\nThese things are working ok for us now, but there are some situations that we can't yet resolve in a satisfying way, leading us to consider updating the tuning api in the oscillators (and filters and anything else that's tuneable) to have not one, but three points of entry: Fixed log2 Offset, Scale-Bound log2 offset, Linear Offset. \r\n\r\nThis + the openness to breaking changes might let us improve some UI/UX around tuning in XT2, and this issue is meant to be a list of potential improvements. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Make the before/after option local, so you can have a microtuned sequencer being pitch bent with constant offset or other combinations like that. This will require some thought to not make the UX too complex. But seems like it'd be worth pursuing. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Make the oscillators play the scale 1/1 when keytrack is disabled.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make oscillator pitch dial a bit more predictable in \"after modulation\" mode (at least with respect to the 1/1), by making the degrees of the loaded scale appear on the dial in the same place they would if the same interval were typed in in \"apply before\" mode. For unequal scales, this assumes 0=the scale 1/1. The user needs understand they won't necessarily hear the same offsets from every MIDI key, which is ok maybe? For equal scales other than 12-edo, this would just be nice though, since it would simply mean the max reach of the param in pitch is the same whether your scale has 12 notes/octave or 34. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Let octave dials offset by the scale repetition interval instead of 2/1.

You type-in \"3/2\" in the pitch field of an oscillator, it won't play 3/2. \r\n\r\nThat's because with apply after modulation checked, putting pitch to 7.00 exactly is remapped to 7 keys up, and typing in 3/2 doesn't land you on 7 steps it lands you on \u22487.02. \r\n\r\nSo you probably expected to land on 3/2 since that's what you typed in, and that interval is in your scale. But instead you landed a bit sharp of the 7th degree in your scale. How sharp depends on what the 8th degree is, since this mode interpolates the pitches between the integer degrees.\r\n\r\nThere are two options for solving this. Either we just document it as it is, basically saying \"in this mode, always type in pitch offsets as 100 cent intervals. \r\n\r\n...or make it so whenever the user types in a ratio that's present in the scale, make sure the param ends in the place that actually makes that sound. \r\n\r\nThe latter would be more intuitive in some cases. But of course, it'd still only be when playing the root of the scale that you'd actually be guaranteed to hear the interval you typed in.

Please describe!**\r\nAs a sound designer, encouraged to make patches with macros, I'd like to make the patches more useful to users, by directing them to different useful 'sweet spots' that the patch offers. Users would then more quickly be able to explore the possibilities of a patch, or reset macros to preset/useful values.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\nIf Surge offered **Articulations** (or some other name) in a menu, then users could select those to bulk-select macro values, or even store their own within the patch. Ideally (and by default anyway?) these macro changes are recorded in the DAW, if armed.\r\n\r\nFor example, as a designer, I could list out several piano configurations, like 'lively', 'felt', 'filtered', 'hammers', 'bass', 'ambient', and so on.\r\n\r\nThe UI might be challenging: Selection (surface UI), and then (deeper menu) Add, Delete, Rename for Articulations, and [stretch goal] Edit, to toggle whether each macro is changed by selection of the articulation.\r\n\r\nMore than macros?: not for MVP. Setting, say, parameters, is effectively a macro and wouldn't be transparent for the user; the answer for this use case is \"more macros\".\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\nIt's possible to save them as separate patches, at the cost of fragmenting the different variants.\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\nCon: As a designer, it's more challenging to hold all the articulations together, than it is to design specialist patches.\r\nCon: If designers had included Articulations, and then change the main patch parameters, then it's a burden to recalibrate the Articulations.\r\nCon: If a patch is able to cross categories with different Articulations, then it's hard to categorize (as a designer) and hard to find (as a user). For example, if a Keys instrument could be made to sound 'bowed', then users won't find the bowed variant easily because the main patch is in Keys.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6974/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6974/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6973", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6973/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6973/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6973/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6973", "id": 1679503762, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes5kGzGS", "number": 6973, "title": "PatchDB::parseFXPIntoDB isn't robust if the file is deleted while parsing", "user": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2176487016, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc2NDg3MDE2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Bug%20Report", "name": "Bug Report", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Item submitted using the Bug Report template"}, {"id": 3248300442, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzMjQ4MzAwNDQy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Patch%20Browser", "name": "Patch Browser", "color": "6CD57B", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/28", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28/labels", "id": 8227677, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCOvoes4AfYtd", "number": 28, "title": "Surge XT 1.x", "description": "Things we could do in the 1.x family but didn't make 1.2 or 1.3", "creator": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 60, "closed_issues": 3, "state": "open", "created_at": "2022-07-22T12:11:50Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-04T08:57:18Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-22T11:52:07Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-01T09:37:05Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "This is basically the cause of #6959 but fixing it is quite hard so in #6959 I just added a wait-until-prior-traversal for a more immediate fix.

Description:**\r\nOneshot Factory WTs are no longer oneshots after moving to assuming 1024 frames when loading a WAV file without loop metadata.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\nVersion: Surge XT

kHz / Process block size: 8 samples\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Select a WT oscillator\r\n2. Load Factory Wavetables -> Oneshot -> [any of them]\r\n3. Notice it's not a oneshot anymore, but a WT with 1024 frames.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nOneshots are still oneshots.\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nA proper fix for importing WAVs without loop information is issue #3436 but until then we should patch the factory files to have the correct metadata.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":
