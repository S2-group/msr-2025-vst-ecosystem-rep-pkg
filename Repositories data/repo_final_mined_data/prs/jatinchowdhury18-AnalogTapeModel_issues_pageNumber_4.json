to lower mids spectrum (sounds similar to rumble / hum on a vinyl player).\r\n\r\nMaybe some sort of unconventional aliasing is produced due to the amount of high frequency content and inharmonic overtones produced? [Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_tree)states: \"Unlike tubular bells, another form of chime, the chimes on a Mark tree do not produce a definite pitch, as they produce inharmonic (rather than harmonic) spectra.\"\r\n\r\nWhen increasing the oversampling amount, the artefacts become less prominent, but are still very noticable even at 8x Oversampling in a 44100 Hz session. \r\n\r\nDecreasing the Input Gain won't do much in terms of reducing the artefacts (only reduction is due to the db decrease, but the amount of produced artefacts relative to the signal remains the same).\r\n\r\nMy guess is that chimes are a good sound source to determine how such a model reacts on very high frequency rich material, whether the performance of the model remains consistent?\r\n\r\nHere are audio example (a) chimes sample without tape model and b) with tape model activated (change file ending from .txt to .wav)\r\n\r\n[Chimes_WITHOUT_tape_model.txt](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel/files/4118006/Chimes_WITHOUT_tape_model.txt)\r\n[Chimes_with_tape_model.txt](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel/files/4118007/Chimes_with_tape_model.txt)\r\n\r\nMy
