Values from 0-49 have an amplitude modulation depth of zero.\n\n This bug seems related to the 'A mod sens' volume bug, in that both occur with a new instance of dexed, and both get corrected if you go to the 'PARM' window and hit 'OK', or if you touch your midi controllers modulation wheel.\n\nexample:\n- open a New instance of dexed. (or reopen a project with dexed)\n- hit 'INIT' to create a new sound.\n- turn up 'A mod sens' on operator 1.\n- turn up 'AMD' to 49.   Notice that there is unexpectedly no tremolo effect up to value 49.\n- hit 'PARM' and press 'OK', Or make some movement on the modulation wheel of your midi controller.   Notice that a middle value of 49 now correctly has a noticeable tremolo, and the range of the 'AMD' control will now correctly be effective from 0-99.\n\nThanks.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/67/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/67/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/66", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/66/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/66/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/66/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/66", "id": 144126176, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNDQxMjYxNzY=", "number": 66, "title": "'A mod sens' volume bug", "user": {"login": "Sentinel77", "id": 18003792, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAzNzky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18003792?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77", "html_url": "https://github.com/Sentinel77", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Sentinel77/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 69343079, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw2OTM0MzA3OQ==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2016-03-29T01:16:49Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-10T16:23:31Z", "closed_at": "2017-04-10T16:23:31Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": " Hi,\n\n First of all,  great app. I'm really enjoying it. Thanks for your great work on this, and everyone else involved. It's amazing how close it is to the real hardware.\n\n I found a bug affecting the volume. It occurs with patches that have Amplitude Modulation Sensitivity turned up.\nThe volume of dexed (0.9.1) can be about 8.8dB lower with those patches, whenever you open your project or open a new instance of dexed.\nThe volume returns to normal if you touch your midi controller keyboards modulation wheel,\nor if you open the 'PARM' window and hit 'OK'.\n\nexample:\n- open a new instance of dexed.\n- hit 'INIT' to create a new sound.\n- turn up 'A mod sens' on operator 1.\n  the volume will sound rather low.\n- hit 'PARM' and press 'OK',  Or  make some movement on the modulation wheel of

Dexed is the first plugin I've actually come across that sets this flag, so it triggered my host's experimental plugin suspension code (most hosts don't implement this flag, I think). Everything would have been fine if the plugin didn't have any inputs (since then it would ignore the flag), but since the plugin claims to have a stereo input, the code is still triggered. So I'd suggest to first off remove the flag and maybe also remove the input channels if they are not required.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/19/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/19/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/18", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/18/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/18/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/18/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/18", "id": 45066026, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0NTA2NjAyNg==", "number": 18, "title": "x64 version closes FL Studio when the \"load\" button is pressed in Dexed", "user": {"login": "arkmabat", "id": 6393706, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTM3MDY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6393706?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat", "html_url": "https://github.com/arkmabat", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arkmabat/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2014-10-07T04:20:58Z", "updated_at": "2017-03-11T04:20:08Z", "closed_at": "2017-03-11T04:20:08Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Just as the above says.

list of manual changes I needed to do:\n- change the libx11 location in the Makefile (could do this in Introjucer but I believe this is Linux version dependent)\n- SInt16 error / size_t error: added

loaded patches from the VST chunk?\n\nI believe this should be possible in the way you load the binary SYX block when starting. Basically you save the block into the VST chunk when unloading the plugin and recall it back when loading the plugin the next time. If you do not find a VST chunk, you fall back to the current solution. When the user imports a SYX file during a session, that block is saved and recalled.\n\nThat way, I can have different projects with different patch banks loaded. This is useful when you use a headless system were you can only use program changes to switch patches and not load new banks on the fly.\n\nhttp://www.juce.com/api/classVSTPluginFormat.html#a666e9aa327d8daaafa05b6b899166ff9\n\ngruss,\nMarkus\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/1", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/1/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/1/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/issues/1/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/issues/1", "id": 25475761, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyNTQ3NTc2MQ==", "number": 1, "title": "Sysex import leads to corrupted patches", "user": {"login": "markusthegeek", "id": 1049733, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk3MzM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1049733?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek", "html_url": "https://github.com/markusthegeek", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markusthegeek/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 69343079, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw2OTM0MzA3OQ==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/asb2m10/dexed/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "asb2m10", "id": 4589493, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODk0OTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4589493?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "asb2m10", "id": 4589493, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODk0OTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4589493?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10", "html_url": "https://github.com/asb2m10", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asb2m10/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2014-01-13T02:49:33Z", "updated_at": "2014-01-14T04:08:42Z", "closed_at": "2014-01-14T04:08:42Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hi Pascal,\n\nthank you very much for your great work with this project!
