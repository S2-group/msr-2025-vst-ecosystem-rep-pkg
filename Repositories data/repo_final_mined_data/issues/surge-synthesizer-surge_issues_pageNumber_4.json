The new Python script does this, but it can also be done manually with the synth. See updated \"Steps to reproduce, below\".\r\n\r\n**Bug Description:** \r\nSurge XT sometimes makes a loud blast of noise when changing presets under a moderate load of notes. The preset most noticeable in presenting the behavior is \".../patches_3rdparty/Inigo Kennedy/Leads/Happy Saws\", but it may happen with others as well.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version** \r\nVersion: Surge XT 1.3.main.c694f89d\r\n NOTE: a recent nightly is required to ensure OSC support, which is used for this test.\r\n\r\nBuild: 2023-10-12 @ 13:49:40 on 'MacBook-Pro.local/local' with 'AppleClang-15.0.0.15000040' using JUCE 7.0.5\r\nSystem: macOS 64-bit Standalone on Apple M2 Pro\r\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz / Process block size: 32 samples\r\nOS: [Mac OS 13.6]\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior, with Python script:**\r\n1. Grab 'Surge_Tester.py.txt' python program attached here; remove the '.txt' extension.\r\n2.  Edit the patch path at the top of Surge_Tester.py to match your system; save changes\r\n3. Start an instance of Surge XT (WARNING: KEEP AMPLIFIED VOLUME LOW AT FIRST!)\r\n4. Run (Python 3) program Surge_Tester.py\r\n5. Noise blast should happen before too long, but let it run a couple of minutes if you don't hear anything. \r\n7. Hit 'ctrl-c' to stop the endless test loop.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce, with Surge GUI:**\r\n1. Load the following two patches:\r\n  - Monster Feedback.fxp         (from \"/patches_3rdparty/Argitoth/FX/Monster Feedback)\r\n  - Tolk.fxp.                     (from \"/patches_factory/Leads/Tolk\")\r\n 2. Cycle between the patches at about 1 change per second (hint: use the 'history' arrows), until the bug manifests.\r\n\r\n**I want to stress again...do NOT run this test at high amplifier levels (especially with headphones)! The noise blast is quite loud.**\r\n\r\n[Surge_Tester_2.py.txt](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/files/12907807/Surge_Tester_2.py.txt)\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7250/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7250/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7249", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7249/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7249/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7249/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7249", "id": 1938425481, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes5zigaJ", "number": 7249, "title": "Skins parser produces \"parse error\" when encountering __MACOSX folders", "user": {"login": "jolohaga", "id": 53976, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53976?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga", "html_url": "https://github.com/jolohaga", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jolohaga/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1862967420, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxODYyOTY3NDIw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Skinning%20Engine", "name": "Skinning Engine", "color": "d3ffaa", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to Surge's skin engine"}, {"id": 2176487016, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc2NDg3MDE2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Bug%20Report", "name": "Bug Report", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Item submitted using the Bug Report template"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/32", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/32", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/32/labels", "id": 9249176, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCOvoes4AjSGY", "number": 32, "title": "Surge XT 1.3", "description": "We thought we'd have 1.2.1 perhaps but it didn't happen, and then PhilS came and started working on OSC, so we have it as a big feature to form a whole new release around it!", "creator": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 101, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2023-04-05T12:36:14Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-08T15:44:21Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2023-12-08T15:44:05Z"}, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2023-10-11T18:15:16Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-14T20:58:21Z", "closed_at": "2023-10-14T20:58:20Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "**Bug Description:**\r\nWhen folders are zipped using the Finder, MacOS can add a __MACOSX folder to the contents of the zip archive.

In the Finder find the download, right-click on it and select \"Compress\"\r\n3. In Surge, drag-and-drop the Finder zipped file\r\n4.

ha.\r\n<https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-rack/issues/937#issuecomment-1730995165>\r\n\r\nSo this gave me an idea. The reason we haven't added initial phase to surge is a couple of fold, but one of them is there's no place for a param. But there is a place in teh API. And we want this for XT2. So I could quite easily do this\r\n\r\n1. Change oscillator::init to have a `float initialPhase=0` argument\r\n2. Visit all the oscillators and implement it. Implementing it is trivial.\r\n3. Don't expose that to the surge VST in the 1.x series. Sorry. Sucks to be you VST users\r\n4. But expose it in the rack modules since they call `::init` directly and aren't bound by the param infrastructure in the same way then\r\n5.

Start Reaper\r\n2. Create a new project\r\n3. `Insert virtual instrument on new track` \r\n4. `VST3i/Surge XT` (Also happens with LV2 or CLAP)\r\n5. Surge XT Window opens. Press `Save` in Patch browser \r\n6. Try to type, does not work (Screenshot 1)\r\n7. Click on `Templates` Text  (Screenshot 2)\r\n8. Text is shaded, but cursor does not move to other box. Only exactly during the click, the cursor blinks once\r\n9. Sometimes the focus does move, not really reproducible\r\n10. Once there is focus in one of the boxes, typing is possible. `TAB` key then reliably changes focus between boxes and typing into any box with active focus works. All boxes however still have the text shaded most of the time, sometimes the background clears. (Screenshot 3)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nText should only be shaded if it is selected. Clicking a text box should move focus to the box and typing into the box should work.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n![Bildschirmfoto vom 2023-08-19 17-08-37](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/assets/583238/f8744e51-512e-48a2-a0f8-c4b8bf812ec5)\r\n![Bildschirmfoto vom 2023-08-19 17-10-10](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/assets/583238/836f65d1-1c19-4e2f-8a68-8c2baeaa457e)\r\n![Bildschirmfoto vom 2023-08-19 17-12-51](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/assets/583238/d8137b3c-04a7-4c14-a429-e141b6217e4b)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: Linux, completely updated Fedora 38\r\n - Host: Reaper\r\n - Version: 6.81\r\n - Happens using both X11 and Wayland\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7191/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7191/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7190", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7190/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7190/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7190/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7190", "id": 1857340870, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCOvoes5YSExm", "number": 7190, "title": "Add 'removeByHostNoteID' method to SurgeSynthesizer", "user": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-08-18T22:08:47Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-18T22:46:06Z", "closed_at": "2023-08-18T22:46:03Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/pulls/7190", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7190", "diff_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7190.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7190.patch", "merged_at": "2023-08-18T22:46:03Z"}, "body": "Mostly to make Phil's live easier with OSC.

GUI.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\nSurge XT 1.2.3.bb8dd2b\r\n\r\n* Version: 1.2.3\r\n* Plugin Type: LV2\r\n* Bitness: 64-bit\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nIn QTractor or MusE, open Surge's native GUI and the \r\n corresponding QTractor or MusE generic GUI.\r\nNow change program in Surge by selecting a program or clicking\r\n program up/down or category up/down.\r\nObserve that all the native GUI controls correctly change to new positions\r\n but the generic GUI controls do not change at all.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nGeneric GUI controls should follow what the native GUI shows\r\n after a program change initiated inside the native GUI.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: OpenSuse Tumbleweed\r\n - Host: Either QTractor or MusE\r\n - Version: QTractor 0.9.33 or MusE 4.1 release or latest master\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nIn LV2 lv2extprg.h, there is this statement (nearly identical to the old DSSI statement):\r\n```\r\n     * A plugin is permitted to re-write the values of its input\r\n     * control ports when select_program is called. The host should\r\n     * re-read the input control port values and update its own\r\n     * records appropriately. (This is the only circumstance in which\r\n     * a LV2 plugin is allowed to modify its own control-input ports.)\r\n```\r\nTrouble is, Surge does not seem to have any midi programs with which I can test\r\n that statement by selecting a program from within our host.\r\nBut also, this bug report is such that changing programs from within Surge GUI\r\n also does not appear to be updating its input control ports.\r\nWhen we instantiate a UI descriptor, we pass a callback for the LV2UI_Write_Function argument.\r\nMost LV2 synths seem to call this when a program changes via the GUI.\r\nThat lets us re-read the input ports and update our records.\r\nBut Surge does not appear to calling this upon program changes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Surge seems to be one of the only plugins to call the 'program_changed' callback\r\n in the _LV2_Programs_Host structure. \r\nThis is good. \r\nBut... Upon the 'program_changed' callback, when I examine all the input control ports\r\n so that I may update our records, none of the input ports have changed at all to reflect what \r\n is now on screen in the native GUI.\r\n\r\nThus, it appears **impossible** for us to determine what is the new state of the on screen GUI controls\r\n after a program change from within the GUI, so that we may update our records.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is seen in both MusE and QTractor.\r\nOther synths tested do update the generic GUI controls after a program change from within the GUI.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

Effects standalone briefly opens and then crashes when using Jabra Elite 75t bluetooth headphones. I'm not sure if this would happen with other bluetooth headphones. I don't have any on hand to test.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\nSurge XT Effects 1.2.3.bb8dd2b\r\n2023-05-05\r\n\r\n* Bitness: 64-bit arm\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Have the Jabra earbuds activated, connected, and set as the computer's audio output.\r\n2. Play some audio. I was listening to something on Apple Music.\r\n3. Click on Surge XT Effects to open it.\r\n4. It will open for a little bit, and you will hear the sound change as the system audio gets rerouted(?). Then it will close, and probably cause an Apple crash report to be generated.\r\n\r\nI think this has something to do with either this model of bluetooth earbuds or bluetooth audio in general, as the app works fine when system audio is set to laptop speakers. Switching to the jabras after the app has successfully opened does not cause the crash.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nSurge XT Effects opens and can be used.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots/GIF/videos to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: 13.4.1 (c) (22F770820d)\r\n - Host:

So a just-directories MIDI programs has bank 0 as the first directory and a mix and match has bank 0 as the raw top level and bank 1 as the first directory c. If there's still banks to be filled we fill them one at a time from factor.
