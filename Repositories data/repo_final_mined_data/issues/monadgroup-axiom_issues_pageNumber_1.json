Some math intrinsics have a hard dependency on SSE4.1 though, so we can't go lower than that.\r\n - As part of the change to SSE, all audio code now uses doubles. This also involves a few changes to the project schema (since control values now need to be stored as doubles).\r\n - `num` values are now passed by-value into every function, which reduces the amount of loads/stores required and means for most cases the numbers can be stored entirely in registers.\r\n - All relevant intrinsic math functions have been rewritten in vectorized code, meaning we no longer rely on libm, and math operations are insanely fast.\r\n - While rewriting the math intrinsics I added a few that were missing, so there are a couple of new functions exposed on Maxim too.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet tested this on macOS ~or 64-bit Windows~ (have tested on 64-bit Windows and it works fine, pretty sure there shouldn't be any problems with macOS), so there are probably still a few broken things on both.

However, this is my first time writing Rust and I've only dabbled lightly in compilers before.. so apologies for the sharp edges and lack of it compiling atm. \r\n\r\nI thought I'd ask your opinions @cpdt before I go too much further/ make any structural changes to what already exists. Any pointers are useful, I suspect some change might be necessary to codegen but I don't want to be too brutal - I imagine you probably have some reasons for the current architecture!\r\n\r\nAlso, how are you debugging the parser at the moment? I thought some tests (like https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell/tree/master/tests/all) might be useful but haven't set any up yet.\r\n\r\n**Parsing**\r\n- Maxim code is matched by regexes in parser/token_stream.rs. Added (broken I suspect) matchers for if, then and else.\r\n- Added tokens If, Then, Else to parser/token.rs\r\n- Added parse_conditional_expr to parser/mod.rs (loosely from https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell/blob/master/examples/kaleidoscope/main.rs#L663)\r\n\r\n**AST**\r\n- Added ConditionalExpression and new_conditional. Should the fields on this be SubExpressions or something else?\r\n\r\n**Mir**\r\n- ast::Blocks with Expressions are converted into CompileResult<mir::Block>s with Statements\r\n- Added Conditional Statement to mir/block/statement.rs\r\n- Added lower_conditional_expression and matcher for it to pass/lower_ast.rs. What is the idea behind lowering the ast? Haven't come across it before.\r\n\r\n**Codegen**\r\n- Added matcher for Statement::Conditional to codegen/block/mod.rs\r\n- Created codegen/block/gen_conditional.rs (from https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell/blob/master/examples/kaleidoscope/main.rs#L999). This is the part I'm probs most unsure about, in the inkwell example everything is converted to floats using compile_expr.

It is now clear to the reader that there are two options in building backends.\r\n\r\nFixes #143 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/144/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/144/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/143", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/143/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/143/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/143/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/issues/143", "id": 377659014, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzNzc2NTkwMTQ=", "number": 143, "title": "Edits to README.md for Clarity", "user": {"login": "jwharrie", "id": 32973688, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTczNjg4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32973688?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie", "html_url": "https://github.com/jwharrie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jwharrie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-11-06T01:48:53Z", "updated_at": "2018-11-08T00:37:33Z", "closed_at": "2018-11-08T00:37:33Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Make a few edits to README.md to improve clarity.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/143/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/143/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/142", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/142/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/142/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/issues/142/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/issues/142", "id": 377146494, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzNzcxNDY0OTQ=", "number": 142, "title": "Fix Mac build", "user": {"login": "cpdt", "id": 16081865, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDgxODY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16081865?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt", "html_url": "https://github.com/cpdt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpdt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 768947565, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw3Njg5NDc1NjU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/monadgroup/axiom/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "ee0701", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2018-11-04T12:12:39Z", "updated_at": "2018-11-05T21:09:06Z", "closed_at": "2018-11-05T11:19:07Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "When building on macOS High Sierra with Xcode 10, the standalone editor immediately segfaults.
