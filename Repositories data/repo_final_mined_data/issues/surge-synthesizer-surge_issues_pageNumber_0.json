It should emphasize two frequencies from [this Wikipedia table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant#Phonetics).\r\n\r\nTo allow switching between the vowels, I wrote lua scripts. In the attached patch [Formant Filter Basic_bug.zip](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/files/14406956/Formant.Filter.Basic_bug.zip) the desired vowel is selected by Macro 1 (named \"Vowel Select\"). \r\n\r\nIn scene A, S-LFO1 contains code to calculate the first frequency for the equalizer, S-LFO2 code for the second frequency.\r\n\r\nIn scene B, S-LFO1 contains code to calculate both frequencies.\r\n\r\nAll the scripts are nearly identical except for the final output. All other settings are identical between the scenes, so theoretically both scenes should generate the same sound but they don't do this.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\n* Version: 1.3.1\r\n* Plugin Type: Standalone\r\n* Bitness: 64-bit\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

Please describe!**\r\nI'm only using Surge XT _**standalone version**_ (thx for doing it too, besides the plugin ones).\r\nMy problem is that when I'm loading a patch for a song, I've always have to set the tempo of the song manualy (on the left side of the virtual keyboard of Surge).\r\nAfter a fresh start, Surge XT standalone always set the tempo at 120 bpm. This value seems to be hard coded since I could not find in any config file a way to set another default (or start up) value.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\nI would like that Surge saves the current tempo value in the current loaded patch when I'm saving/overwritting it.\r\nWhen used as a DAW plugin, Surge XT could simply ignore this parameter of the patch, since Surge should receive the current tempo value from the DAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\nNo idea...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\nI'm using Surge XT standalone in Debian 12 (stable with KDE Plasma) on an used Dell Latitude 7200 2-in-1 (only with touch screen). Surge XT is controlled by a hardware MIDI keyboard Nektar Impact GX61. Audio output over the onboard sound card (phone output) of the Dell Latitude.\r\nIt's a killer standalone instrument for < 400,- EUR!!!\r\n(and I'm also using Dexed and other software synths on this cheap but powerful hardware)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7529/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7529/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7528", "id": 2151052973, "node_id": "I_kwDOCOvoes6ANnat", "number": 7528, "title": "macOS based latency in standalone with audio input", "user": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1178875892, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMTc4ODc1ODky", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/macOS", "name": "macOS", "color": "1e32b5", "default": false, "description": "macOS related issues"}, {"id": 2176487016, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc2NDg3MDE2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/labels/Bug%20Report", "name": "Bug Report", "color": "1d76db", "default": false, "description": "Item submitted using the Bug Report template"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/28", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/28/labels", "id": 8227677, "node_id": "MI_kwDOCOvoes4AfYtd", "number": 28, "title": "Surge XT 1.x", "description": "Things we could do in the 1.x family but didn't make 1.2 or 1.3", "creator": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 60, "closed_issues": 3, "state": "open", "created_at": "2022-07-22T12:11:50Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-04T08:57:18Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-02-23T13:06:17Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-26T23:49:08Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "On macOS 14.x the 1.3 standalone, when input is bound to the MacBook pro microphone (and perhaps other inputs) has a noticeable playback latency independent of output block size.\r\n\r\nTo test open surge in logic and simultaneously open the standalone.

Meaning that if I set the split channel to 8, notes on channels 1-8 are played by Scene A, and channels 9-16 are played by Scene B. The manual at https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/manual-xt/#scene-select-and-scene-mode states \"Channel Split Notes from MIDI channels **below** the split MIDI channel will be played by scene A, notes from MIDI channels **above and including** the split MIDI channel will be played by scene B.\" If that's the intended behaviour, then this is a bug. Or alternately, you could change the manual text to read \"below and including\" and \"above\" respectively to match the current behaviour.\r\nAs a side note, I'm wondering how this is actually supposed to work if the split channel is set to 1, and if the \"above and including\" behaviour would be the intended one. This would practically mean that channels 1 and above (literally meaning \"all channels\") would be played by scene B.\r\nAs it is now of course, if you set the split channel to 1, then channel 1 is played by Scene A and channels 2 and above will be played by Scene B.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\n* Version: 1.3.1\r\n* Plugin Type: CLAP, VST3\r\n* Bitness: 64-bit\r\n\r\n**Computer

implementation.\r\n## Concept\r\nChord storage is playing a chord or multiple notes with one key.  \r\nThere are several patches that do something similar but use multiple oscillators for multiple notes instead of multiple voices.\r\n\r\nBenefits over the current workaround\r\n- It allows you to use all 3 oscillators.\r\n- You can play more than 3 notes per scene.  \r\n\r\nSome examples of synths that have this feature \r\n- Roland Alpha Juno 1/2\r\n- Korg Poly 800\r\n- Novation Ultranova\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nYou first enable chord storage by opening the poly playmode context menu.    \r\nIf there isn't a chord stored a popup opens saying to play some notes.  \r\nThere will be a button that says record chord.\r\n\r\nthe chord could be stored in SurgeSceneStorage as a list of integers representing midi notes. \r\n\r\nwhenever surge recieves a midi on message it transposes and plays all the notes in the chord.\r\n\r\nwhenever surge recieves a midi off message it transposes and turns off all the notes in the chord.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI might try to make this but I haven't contributed to surge before so who knows how that will go.", "reactions": {"url":

On windows, since the forumla evaluator contains a std::string and msft allocates that even for empty, that lead to a small per voice leak.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue in two ways\r\n\r\n1. It makes sure that the placement new constructor and destructor calls match. Especially since the voice storage is now in a std::array so it is destroyed at exit and constructed at startup, we add two calls to ~SurgeVoice and one to ::SurgeVoice()\r\n2. That string shouldn't be a member anyway. Its only on the lua error path where things are already breaking various realtime rules. So make it a unique ptr and alloc it explicitly only if needed and reset it once consumed\r\n\r\nAddresses #7478", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7480/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7480/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7479", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7479/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7479/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7479/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7479", "id": 2103171655, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCOvoes5lNajI", "number": 7479, "title": "Don't build Lua tests if Lua not available", "user": {"login": "taylordotfish", "id": 59985047, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTg1MDQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59985047?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish", "html_url": "https://github.com/taylordotfish", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taylordotfish/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2024-01-27T03:37:14Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-27T03:53:15Z", "closed_at": "2024-01-27T03:53:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/pulls/7479", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7479", "diff_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7479.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7479.patch", "merged_at": "2024-01-27T03:53:15Z"}, "body": "Building Surge without Lua using `-DSURGE_SKIP_LUA=ON` results in an error because [UnitTestsLUA.cpp](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/blob/1ddf4df83c642d9da4b16a5d6483732e502275ad/src/surge-testrunner/UnitTestsLUA.cpp) is still compiled and tries to use Lua.

I forked the repo on 2024/01/26, cloned my fork to a local folder, created my own working branch from the main branch and generated the Visual Studio 2019 project files via CMake. \r\n2.  Then I fired up the generated Surge.sln VS solution file via double-click in Windows Explorer. \r\n3. In VS, I built the surge-xt/surge_xt_Standalone project in Surge.sln on Windows with Visual Studio 2019 in Debug configuration. To do this, one must right-click on surge-xt_Standalone in the \"Solution Explorer\" and  click on \"Set as StartUp Project\". The text of the project name will then become boldface. Make sure that the \"Debug\" configuration is selected (I think, it should be), \r\n4. Then I click the \"Build+Run\" button (the green \"Play\" button). This will initiate the build and when its done run Surge. \r\n5. After the Surge GUI has openened, I immediately close it. \r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n The \"Output\" window of VS now says (among other things):\r\n\r\n> Detected memory leaks!\r\n> Dumping objects ->\r\n> {357844} normal block at 0x000001DB106116A0, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357822} normal block at 0x000001DB10611820, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357800} normal block at 0x000001DB10611BA0, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357778} normal block at 0x000001DB106129A0, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357756} normal block at 0x000001DB10612E20, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357734} normal block at 0x000001DB10612FA0, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> Object dump complete.\r\n\r\nWhen I do not immediately close the window but play a note and then close the window, I get even more leaked objects:\r\n\r\n> Detected memory leaks!\r\n> Dumping objects ->\r\n> {357844} normal block at 0x000001C5FC3D6130, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357822} normal block at 0x000001C5FC3D6B30, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357800} normal block at 0x000001C5FC3D6430, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357778} normal block at 0x000001C5FC3D65B0, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357756} normal block at 0x000001C5FC3D6DB0, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {357734} normal block at 0x000001C5FC3D6AB0, 60 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <            <   > 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 00 00 00 \r\n> {310443} normal block at 0x000001C5FC275180, 16 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <  s             > F8 ED 73 FA C5 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \r\n> {310442} normal block at 0x000001C5FC275130, 16 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <  s             > D8 D4 73 FA C5 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \r\n> {310441} normal block at 0x000001C5FC274C80, 16 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <  s             > B8 BB 73 FA C5 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \r\n> {310440} normal block at 0x000001C5FC275590, 16 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <  s             > 98 A2 73 FA C5 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \r\n> {310439} normal block at 0x000001C5FC275310, 16 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <x s             > 78 89 73 FA C5 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \r\n> {310438} normal block at 0x000001C5FC274B90, 16 bytes long.\r\n>  Data: <Xps             > 58 70 73 FA C5 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \r\n> Object dump complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Host: None (Standalone)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nApparently, the 6 objects of 60 bytes are always leaked and additionally, additional 6 objects of size 16 bytes are leaked for each midi note that has been played. It doesn't matter if the notes are played via the virtual keyboard or a hardware midi keyboard. Trying to figure it out by defining _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC to get more detailed information about the leak was unsuccessful because with this macro defined, Surge doesn't compile anymore (when trying to build, 17 projects succeed, 4 fail). This seems to be due to the fact that defining _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC will cause standard library function names like malloc, free, etc. to be re-#defined via preprocessor macros which breaks compilation of code that uses these names for some of its own (member) functions. Using these names will cause syntax errors. JUCE does this, see here: https://forum.juce.com/t/conflict-with--crtdbg-map-alloc-visual-studio/6040. Something in the \"eurorack.vcxproj\" project apparently does this, too.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7478/reactions", "total_count": 0,
