E.g., if I play a repeated triad at about 180bpm while simultaneously moving a fader, the rhythm goes ragged and amsynth will still continue trying to play notes for several seconds after I've stopped.  I can also reproduce the problem without touching any other controls if I just play a long fast glissando.\n\nThe one other soft synth I tried (bristol's b3 emulation) didn't see this problem, so I'm assuming it's an amsynth issue.\n\nI'm on Fedora 24 with amsynth-1.6.4.1.fc24.  I'm inexperienced with linux music, but experienced with linux development, and happy to build newer versions from git, etc., if that would help debug.  I'm running amsynth on a new laptop (Lenovo T460s w/ Core i7-6600U CPU @ 2.60GHz).  Setup is all Fedora defaults, using qjackctl to set up jack, except that I had to bump some ulimits so that jack and amsynth could succesfully memlock and get realtime priority.\n", "reactions":

"active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hosts that exhibit this problem include:\n- [JUCE/examples/audio plugin host](https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE/tree/master/examples/audio%20plugin%20host) \n- [Tracktion](https://www.tracktion.com/products/t5-daw)\n\nThe amsynth GUI displays fine but mouse clicks are not detected.\n\nThis is because GTK button press events are not being generated - using `gdk_event_handler_set` to inspect all events reveals that GDK is not emitting `GDK_BUTTON_PRESS` events.\n\nAn initial round of debugging points to this being an issue with the way JUCE forwards XEvents to the plugin's child window. JUCE uses `XSendEvent` (see [juce_VSTPluginFormat.cpp](https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE/blob/95c66f5659141b943d8d097902da571812924ab7/modules/juce_audio_processors/format_types/juce_VSTPluginFormat.cpp#L2343)) but GDK seems to ignore mouse clicks that have the `send_event` flag set - whether this is intentional or not I do not yet know.\n\nA crude workaround is to not reparent amsynth's GUI window inside the JUCE-owned parent. Event handling then works fine, but this leads to two top-level windows being seen.\n\nInstalling an `_XEventProc` may offer a solution, but so far attempts to get this working on a 64-bit machine have caused crashes. It's not clear whether this mechanism is widely used and therefore reliably implemented in hosts.\n\nFurther investigation required...\n- [x] _XEventProc 64-bit support\n- [x] mouse event handling\n- [x] popup menus\n- [ ] parameter value tooltips\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/22/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

I work with amsynth in a raspberry with a master keyboard, and, with that setup, I just can't change my tuning during a song. I have to shutdown all my things, change a file on a SD and reload everything. So, I was thinking about how change that...\nOne solution will be to work with SysEx midi and doing some midi-vodoo to implement this idea through midi signal: When a signal is received, it change the scale. But this is not very useful, you will have to specify a list of scale, and change a lot the code.\n\nThe other solution, much better I think was to implement a new parameter in the presets, a scale, like a path to a different tuning file (or, much better I think, include this file in the preset). Now you can change the scale trough midi (by changing the preset), and adapt your preset according to the scale.\nEven better, adding a note reference (different than a A 440), because doing a 16-tone per octave only in 440 is not very funny...\n\nIt will need some adjustment, but what do you think about that ?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/19/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/19/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/18", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/18/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/18/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/18/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/amsynth/amsynth/pull/18", "id": 158562478, "node_id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzI2MzM4MDM=", "number": 18, "title": "Allow microtonal in plugins", "user": {"login": "nobrakal", "id": 6417395, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTczOTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6417395?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal", "html_url": "https://github.com/nobrakal", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nobrakal/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2016-06-05T16:32:25Z", "updated_at": "2016-06-13T19:13:05Z", "closed_at": "2016-06-13T19:13:05Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/pulls/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/amsynth/amsynth/pull/18", "diff_url": "https://github.com/amsynth/amsynth/pull/18.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/amsynth/amsynth/pull/18.patch", "merged_at": "2016-06-13T19:13:05Z"}, "body": "Hi\n\nJust added few lines to allow the use of microtonal tunings in plugins (at least with dssi) through the conf file.

Its just perfect.\n\nRichard\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/8/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/8/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/7", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/7/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/7/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/7/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/amsynth/amsynth/issues/7", "id": 109231933, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMDkyMzE5MzM=", "number": 7, "title": "Tuning Issues.", "user": {"login": "therealkitman", "id": 14888092, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODg4MDky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14888092?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman", "html_url": "https://github.com/therealkitman", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/therealkitman/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 16407504, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNjQwNzUwNA==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/labels/Type:%20Bug", "name": "Type: Bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-10-01T05:29:58Z", "updated_at": "2016-03-30T14:48:45Z", "closed_at": "2015-10-03T09:15:18Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hi,\n\nI downloaded and compiled amsynth 1.6.0 for use as a LV2 plugin in Muse.

smoothly, especially for the AMP ENV, whereas the linear ADSR causes AMP ENV to change abruptly (notable on presets with short release that are meant for keys; e.g. Pianola from BrianBanks1).\nThis behaviour is said to be similar to classic analog synths.\n\nUnfortunately since both AMP ENV and FILTER ENV uses the same ADSR class, the FILTER ENV is also changed.\nFor me personally, exponential ADSR is always preferable for AMP ENV, while for FILTER ENV linear ADSR is different, but not less preferable.\n\nWould it be better to have both? if so then there should be a way of choosing between them.\nI could think of two ways of switching,\n- a switch between the old linear or newer exp,\n- or a knob where linear behaviour is simulated with having large overshoot and scaling.\n\nThoughts?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/amsynth/amsynth/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart":
