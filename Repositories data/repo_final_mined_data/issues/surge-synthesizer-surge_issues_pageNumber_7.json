In Cubase, select an instrument track containing an instance of Surge XT\r\n2. In the inspector on the left-hand side, click 'edit instrument' to re-open the instance of Surge XT\r\n3. Exit the instance, and re-open it, it should be zoomed in larger than last time.\r\n4. Repeat until it covers an area larger than your desktop resolution.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nI expected the window to be the same size as last time, not bigger.\r\n\r\nI'm holding off on the screenshots because... it's the same thing. But bigger. I'm also not sure about the possibility it's just my DAW, I feel like I would've been able to find a previously reported closed issue at least mentioning it.

REAPER (which I'll henceforth capitalize as \"Reaper\") and attempting to resize Surge beyond single-screen size, you are unable to scroll up/down or left/right to view the entire GUI. Trying to manually shrink/unshrink the window to \"trick\" the scrollbars into appearing likewise does not work.\r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\n1.1.2\r\n\r\n* Version: As previously stated, 1.1.2\r\n* Plugin Type: [VST2, VST3, AU] VST3 and CLAP\r\n* Bitness: [32-bit or 64-bit] 64\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open Reaper\r\n2. Load Surge\r\n3. Change zoom level to something beyond the capabilities of a single screen to show at once\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nScrollbars should appear if the plugin real estate is larger than the available window/screen real estate.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\nI can post if deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. Windows 10] Windows 10\r\n - Host: [e.g. Bitwig, Logic, Cubase, Reaper] Reaper\r\n - Version: [e.g. 2.4]

newsource` and `queue_refresh = true;`. Doing that we cause recreating all sliders. But we also repaint some components that cause repainting the sliders of the modulation source and we have that blinking. To prevent that, I set `needsModUpdate = true;` instead of calling `refresh_mod()` so that 'refresh_mod()' would only cause one repainting. \r\nIssue:

reports\r\n\r\n```\r\nTrace98 \u2014 Yesterday at 6:55 PM\r\nHello, \r\n-using Vintage Ladder (Type 1 not Type 2) in filter 2, in any configuration where the filter comes after an active waveshaper\r\nusing one of the following\r\n (soft medium hard ojd sine add13 add15 addsqr3 full rect halfpos halfneg sft1fold 1fold 2fold wcfold and from sin+x onward)\r\ncauses the cpu to spike up to 100 immediately.\r\nAdding to the weirdness the bug doesn't happen when pressing 3 or more notes simultaneously at the same time;\r\nit only happens when pressing 1 or 2 notes, after the bug manifests adding other ntoes won't fix it.\r\nSometimes it doesn't happen instantly, it takes a moment or some note ons, but after it happens it stays there\r\n-Reaper v6.78, Win 10,  both CLAP and VST3, latest surge nightly 1.2.nightly.7473f5e (bug happened even in b6c8442)\r\nbaconpaul \u2014 Yesterday at 7:00 PM\r\nAre you in stereo routing? If you put it in mono routing does the problem resolve with 5 notes?\r\nThe vintage ladders are deterministic not iterative so something must be either causing a nan or under flow\r\n(but we have software denormals off)\r\nTrace98 \u2014 Yesterday at 7:05 PM\r\nit's a bit weird, i'm testing a bit\r\nby mono routing you mean every routing but wide and l-r right?\r\nbaconpaul \u2014 Yesterday at 7:06 PM\r\nYeah like s1 is perfect\r\nTrace98 \u2014 Yesterday at 7:08 PM\r\nyeah happens there too\r\nwith 1 2 3 5 5 7 notes simultaneously\r\nwith 4 or 8 notes it resolves\r\nit's hard to track everything, now when switching between modes the bug persisted. it's very erratic\r\nbaconpaul \u2014 Yesterday at 7:15 PM\r\nGreat can you save your crashing patch as an fxp so I can try it?\r\n```\r\n\r\nmy theory is that the model is getting an inactive voice in the simd slot (as all models do) but something about the model and un-initialized is making it run away or nan

I have encountered a number of problems:\r\n\r\n1. could not create a \"Surge XT\" folder under C:\\users\\<me>\\Documents\r\n2. could not open SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml for writing when switching skins from the default to Surge Dark\r\n3. Exception occurred while creating category folder when saving any preset. \r\n\r\n**Surge XT Version**\r\n\r\n* Version: 1.1.2d3568a9 also NIGHTLY-2023-03-21-06a6c9e\r\n* Plugin Type: CLAP, also standalone\r\n* Bitness: 64 bit\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. install Surge XT from the main website\r\n2. launch Surge XT from the start menu\r\n3. observe the first error, unable to create Surge XT folder in C:\\users\\<me>\\Documents\r\n\r\n1. create a Surge XT folder manually (if this is not done, Surge crashes upon selection of the skin)\r\n2. click the menu button and select \"Skins...Surge Dark\"\r\n3. observe the error \"could not open SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml for writing\"\r\n4. create a SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml manually\r\n5. close Surge XT\r\n6. reopen Surge XT, notice that the skin is back to the default\r\n7. attempt to change the skin to Surge Dark again, observe the error once more\r\n8. notice that the manually created SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml is still 0 bytes\r\n\r\n1. in the main Surge XT window, click \"Save\"\r\n2. change the category from \"Templates\" to \"abc\"\r\n3. leave the name \"Init Saw\"\r\n4. change Author to \"abc\"\r\n5. click save, observe the error \"Exception occurred while creating category! Most likely, invalid characters were used to name the category...\"\r\n6. click ok\r\n\r\n**OTHER STEPS**\r\n\r\n1. click the patch name to open the patch browser\r\n2. under Functions, click open user patches folder\r\n3. nothing happens\r\n4. click \"open factory patches folder\" \r\n5. observe that the factory patches folder opens\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\n1. expected user folder to be created\r\n2. expected user defaults file to be created\r\n3. expected to be able to switch skins permanently\r\n4. expected to be able to save user patches\r\n5. expected to be able to open the user patches folder from the patches browser\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots/GIF/videos to help explain your problem.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13843226/227028720-926e37c8-9dbe-43fc-a16a-e6fc5953cad9.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13843226/227028772-451b337a-4bf7-4967-b2c7-63a720bcb570.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13843226/227028803-141b25a4-20f1-4794-85f7-68910d62cc2c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13843226/227028847-9c02347a-c7b1-4e44-8cfd-f202909b8410.png)\r\n\r\n**Computer

This allows any stopband leakage to be less likely to produce aliasing at higher sample rates (48k, 96k etc). However, this should probably be a toggleable option for those users who sample Surge at high sample rates, expecting harmonics to be present because e.g. they are going to slow down the sample.\r\n\r\nb) Voice-level nonlinear filters and waveshapers could be given more headroom by inserting a voice-level half-rate filter right before them. That is, currently even \"clean\" oscillators (those expected not to alias significantly) produce harmonics up to half of oversampled Nyquist. If instead, there were only silence above the range of human hearing, these otherwise inaudible harmonics couldn't become potentially-audible aliasing after passing through nonlinear operations. Granted, with the clean oscillators these harmonics are already usually quiet due to natural decay of harmonic amplitudes, unless you produce very high notes. This should also be toggleable for the same reasons as in a) (possibly the same toggle option).\r\n\r\nc) Not quite half-band related but close enough to be worth mention here: modulation of filter cutoff should probably be clamped similarly to 22.05KHz (this suggestion came from @mkruselj). Unfortunately especially with self-oscillating filters this means a very digital sounding fixed ringing at this max frequency under modulation (like certain unnamed commercial digital synthesizers that have filters that clamp at ~10k), and even though it's beyond the range of human hearing it could produce intermodulation or aliasing that is audible. However, at 44.1KHz a lack of such clamping basically guarantees aliasing in this scenario.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6860/reactions",
