edited.\r\n\r\nThe constraint is: Parameter needs to be copyable with memcpy so it can't have complex types like std::string as data members\r\n\r\nBut other than that everything can be std::string and it can easily have complex types as interface points\r\n\r\nSo, like\r\n\r\n```\r\n  void get_display(char *txt, bool external = false, float ef = 0.f) const;\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould easily change to\r\n\r\n```\r\nstd::string get_display(bool external = false, float ef = 0.f);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then mark old get_display as deprecated, make it call get_display string version and do a strncpy \r\n\r\nBut these members in parameter\r\n```\r\n char name[NAMECHARS]{}, dispname[NAMECHARS]{}, name_storage[NAMECHARS]{}, fullname[NAMECHARS]{};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd as to that override I meant\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid get_display(char *t, bool ext = false, float ef = 0)\r\n{\r\n   auto gd = get_display(ext, ef);\r\n   strncpy(t, TEXT_SIZE-1, gd.c_str());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nuntil you remove all get_displays etc....", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6730/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

I have a suggestion to aid usability for keyboard users - the typing keyboard that is.  If I set up a parameter with modulation, could the LFO controls region switch to showing that modulator?  So if I add a modulator to my osc 1 pitch using voice 1, if I then alt full stop to the LFO controls region, it should be on the voice 1 controls.  If I then added a filter, and modulation of the cut off frequency with voice 2, and I go to the LFO controls, it would have shifted to the voice 2 controls.  So whenever I set up a new modulation the focus of the LFO controls region shifts to show that modulator.  This would save having to go to the modulator region to select the LFO.\r\n\r\nbaconpaul \u2014 Today at 5:15 PM\r\n\r\noh so like \"add modulation from lfo1\" in the menu selects lfo1?\r\nthat's a bit of a pain for the signted ui since that menu is meant to allow you to add modulators from \"away\" sources while looking at \"current\" sources. but i see why you want it.\r\n\r\nChessel \u2014 Today at 5:16 PM\r\n\r\nYes.

Please describe!**\r\nI think everybody agrees Surge XT is becoming a synth swiss army knife of features which is good, but it's also a bit bad for beginners.\r\nWhy? Because it gets overwhelming when you want to learn then basic synth concepts. There are so many options it's hard for beginners to see the 'big picture' of how a synth works at basic level. I'm a beginner myself and I'm learning Surge myself by 'ignoring' the most advanced features (just to not have too much concepts to understand all at once) and then slowly learning those too, when I know the basics.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\nI would like to' request a feature that can set Surge into standard or advanced mode.\r\n\r\nStandard mode allows changing the most basic features so Surge can be used as a learning tool for people wanting to learn digital synths or for people not needing the more advanced features. But Standard mode should make certain advanced options unavailable (disable the menu item or button so it requires not much code changes and the user just can't click it) so beginners are not 'lost' in the ever growing amount of features. \r\nMaybe limiting the number of parallel things too (or number of LFOs, ...)\r\n\r\nAdvanced mode should be Surge XT as it is now: all options and features enabled.\r\n\r\nWhat does the dev team think of this?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6667/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

manual to Dutch.\r\n\r\nHowever I have no knowledge of html, tools, compiling documentation, websites, ... \r\nSo I only can use a text editor or a program like LibreOffice\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can translate the text and provide the team with a LibreOffice document containing the translated text, so you can convert it to the right format to put online (like the English version)?\r\nI will put in all pictures too and respect all paragraphs of the text, so you can exactly see where the text is located and it can be copy-pasted very easy for the person who will put it in the desired format.\r\n\r\nPs: please note I'm autistic and need VERY clear instructions on how to do this correctly (I mean the format to use for the translation. The translation itself is no problem as I have good English knowledge).\r\nAs a consequence of my autism, I don't like to go into chatboxes like Discord (real-time chat) so going to surge's Discord server is not an option for me.\r\nSo I prefer contacting on github here or if anybody wants to help me personally by email (to get me up-and-running) that's OK too.\r\n\r\nPs 2: I have a very strong dedication when I'm doing something. This means I want to keep updating my translation for updates.\r\nUnfortunately I never worked with github and don't know how to do a PR, ... I'm actually a bit scared of doing something wrong.\r\nIf it's possible, I would like to give my translation here as an attachment so a contributor can submit it in the correct way.\r\nMaybe if it's easy to do this on github (I never used github), I can try to do it myself.\r\n\r\nSo that's why I ask if somebody can 'guide' me here so I can contribute to this wonderfull project by translating the manual to Dutch.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nLien\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6665/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6665/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6664", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6664/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6664/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6664/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/6664", "id": 1421233189, "node_id": "PR_kwDOCOvoes5Bb4pM", "number": 6664, "title": "Tag Support expanded in a couple of ways", "user": {"login": "baconpaul", "id": 13387561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul", "html_url": "https://github.com/baconpaul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2022-10-24T18:19:39Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-24T19:46:38Z", "closed_at": "2022-10-24T19:46:37Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/pulls/6664", "html_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/6664", "diff_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/6664.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/6664.patch", "merged_at": "2022-10-24T19:46:37Z"}, "body": "1.
