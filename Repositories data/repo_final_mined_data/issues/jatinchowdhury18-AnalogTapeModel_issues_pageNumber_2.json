highest oversampling setting, you'd change some settings around, decide you'd want to use some preset instead, start scrolling through them. Your oversampling setting would get overwritten with the (typically low) one from a preset, potentially doing so without you noticing and possibly introducing some aliasing to your master.

The update works when running the .exe installer but it will not work when copying the .vst3 file directly to another PC. I have tried clearing the cache and rescanning VSTs and i have tried restarting the PC.\r\nWe like to be able to copy the plugins directly so it is easy to rebuild the room rather than having to run lots of installers on lots of PCs one after another.\r\nSome plugins we use have files that also need copying to ProgramData, but I couldn't see anything there for ChowDSP and the last versions worked great only copying the .vst3 file.\r\nAny help you can offer would be greatly appreciated :-)\r\nMany thanks,\r\nStephen\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

Please describe.**\r\nSince the new version 2.8.0 there is finally an azimuth parameter. This is great in principle, because it makes the simulation much more realistic.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHowever, what is still missing is somehow a kind of dynamic setting of the value. If I currently specify a value here, then this is statically applied to the signal over the entire time. Could not notice any change, at least at first glance, when I changed other parameters. For real tape recordings, however, this is not the case. To emulate the sound of a real tape recorder, this value would also have to contain a certain dynamic. Azimuth can be very small but also large during playback - i.e. sometimes the phase shift is larger, then smaller again. I know this only too well from digitizing old recordings. There I already had the craziest discoveries depending on the tape age.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be desirable if the whole thing was a bit more realistic. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWould be very happy to provide more info, but the requirement is very difficult to prove well with pictures, because it depends on the signal. \r\n", "reactions": {"url":

BigSur\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI downloaded the package and installed the .vst in the plugin-folder VST (and the app in the apps-folder). When I startup Reason DAW I got several mentions, that this is from unknown developer. Inside Reason it is shown as unknown developer and unknown type (none of  instrument, effect...). When I enable it and restart Reason nothing changes.\r\n\r\nIn the System Preferences this is also recognized: CHOWTapeModel.vst was blocked ... because it is from not identfied developer.\r\nI tried to press the button \"Open Anyway\", but there is no effect.\r\n\r\nWhen I use only the .vst3 plugin (installed into plugins/VST3) nothing happens.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nShould work after installation.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nCould make them, if you really mean that would help. :)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - MacOS Big Sur\r\n - Reason 11\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm really new to this world of plugins. I would not wonder, if it was my fault. Then I'm sorry but would be glad, if got some help.\r\nIf not: My simplest estimated guess is, that this is because it has no plugin-type, Reason doesn't know what to do with it.", "reactions":

Load CHOWTapeModel to a MIDI or audio track from Audio Effects folder\r\n2. Select CHOWTapeModel in the detail view and press Ctrl-G or right click and press Group to place the track in an Audio Effect Rack\r\n3.
