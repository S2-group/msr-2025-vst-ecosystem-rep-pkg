When compiling `little` on Linux I noticed several issues here.\r\n\r\n1. Compatibility issues with `sprintf_s(...)`. This function only exists in Windows and the equivalent (for Unix-based systems) is `snprintf(...)`.  Windows do have `snprintf(...)` (see [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/snprintf-snprintf-snprintf-l-snwprintf-snwprintf-l?view=msvc-170)) so using that function reasonably increase compatibility between two systems. Another function, called `strncpy_s(...)` is again, Windows specific. However, `strncpy(...)` can do exactly the same job except it will not have `numberOfElements` param (which seems to me unreasonable and confusing to use).\r\n\r\n2. There are several areas in code, I saw casting is unreasonable and does a totally different job. Most of them are incompatible pointer casts and at line [349](https://github.com/Beariish/little/blob/1a64cbff67a3058311315d014b22ccf8bab46c3c/src/little.h#L349); it's representing pointer insider pointer and comparing or doing arithmetic work will yield invalid operands error. I'm not sure which compiler you've used that ignores this thing.

(**test_sbrtrace_hello**) that Sabre started, \r\ni.e., `./sabre ./plugins/sbr-trace/libsbr-trace.so -- test_sbrtrace_hello`.\r\nI followed what was mentioned in the README and loaded debug-tools/gdb-symbol-loader.py, but it did not work.\r\nI wanted to debug the target program because I had encountered plugins in other scenarios that caused the target binary to crash, so I had to use gdb to debug and check.\r\n\r\nThe following is the entire process of my debugging, am I missing anything and what do I need to do about it?\r\n\r\n**test_sbrtrace_hello**\r\n```c\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\r\n  printf(""Hello World!\\n"");\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLet\'s execute the command, and see this:\r\n```bash\r\n./sabre

it.\r\n![image](https://github.com/srg-imperial/SaBRe/assets/44093631/bfe8b90e-ce6c-4273-b77a-1afed76748a7)\r\n\r\nWhether I am operating improperly, I hope to get your reply, thank you very

required to be bundled together in order for tests to pass:\r\n- Statically links [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) to both SaBRe and all plugins by default.\r\n  - **Static vs Dynamic**: I chose to statically link mimalloc in order to avoid where the `libmimalloc.so` library should be placed. Having one binary that you can move anywhere you want is much more flexible.\r\n  - **Why mimalloc**: mimalloc uses `mmap` to handle its heap. This creates a natural separation between SaBRe+plugins and the client. mimalloc is also relatively small and uses `cmake` that makes it ""easy"" to integrate its build with SaBRe.\r\n    - I also tried to integrate `jemalloc` but `jemalloc` by default uses `brk()` so we end up having the same issue as `libc`. \r\n    - I didn\'t try `tcmalloc`.\r\n  - **Why do we patch mimalloc**: mimalloc by default will try and mmap pages at an empty space at a very low address space (look [here](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/blob/master/src/os.c#L416) and you can verify for your own interest by running: `LD_PRELOAD=./libmimalloc.so.1.6 cat /proc/self/maps | less`). These maps are created with `mmap` when SaBRe starts (as SaBRe now uses mimalloc). Now when we load a client that uses `tsan`, `tsan` scans the memory to check what is there already. We had issues with this scanning process before, this is why we have this SaBRe code [here](https://github.com/srg-imperial/SaBRe/blob/master/loader/ld_sc_handler.c#L45). `tsan` doesn\'t recognize these mimalloc-heap memory areas as ""standard"" and throws an error when scans the process memory maps. You can find the `tsan` allowed ranges [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/1624be938dd2badf8297e63b6b330882b8023372/compiler-rt/lib/tsan/rtl/tsan_platform.h#L58-L76), whatever is outside of these ranges, will make `tsan` fail.  In the beginning I though of patching the SaBRe code to hide the mimalloc-heap area but I think this will create more issues rather than solve anything. So the easiest way is to disable the mimalloc hint, and delegate the `mmap` area to the kernel. This is absolutely fine from mimalloc\'s perspective.\r\n  - **What is `MI_LOCAL_DYNAMIC_TLS=ON`**: Read [here](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/147).\r\n  - **Static linking vs compiling with Object**: mimalloc suggests an alternative building way [here](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc#static-override). Honestly I tried to make this work but `cmake` made my life extremely hard and at some point I just quit. If anyone has an opinion regarding `.a` vs `.o` static linking, I would also like to know more.\r\n- Fixes (in a slow way) TLS swapping.\r\n  - As we discussed, the plugin lives in the link maps of SaBRe. Thus switching the TLS is mandatory every time we jump from the client to the plugin. This PR safeguards all access points to the plugin (i.e. syscalls and vDSO) and properly switches the TLS.\r\n  - The following solution introduces overhead as we introduce 2 extra syscalls for every client syscall. The ideal solution would be if the plugin were to live in the same link maps as the client.\r\n    - The exact amount of overhead is to be measured.\r\n- Fixes an infinite recursion case that vDSO and syscalls are vulnerable to.\r\n  - mimalloc uses vDSO to sync heap access. SaBRe patches the whole vDSO shared object. This creates an infinite recursion situation when mimalloc (or any vDSO call in general) from inside the plugin makes a vDSO call which again ends up in the plugin handler which creates an infinite recursion.', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/issues/54/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/issues/54/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None, 'score': 1.0}]",81.0,False,"[{'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/issues/88', 'repository_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe', 'labels_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/issues/88/labels{/name}', 'comments_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/issues/88/comments', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/issues/88/events', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/srg-imperial/SaBRe/pull/88', 'id': 1315887109, 'node_id': 'PR_kwDOCdb2lc47_mod', 'number': 88, 'title': 'Use xmm0 to pass context to post_clone_hook', 'user': {'login': 'RiscInside', 'id': 66870461, 'node_id': 'MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODcwNDYx', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66870461?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/RiscInside', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/RiscInside/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'user_view_type': 'public', 'site_admin': False}, 'labels': [], 'state': 'closed', 'locked': False, 'assignee': {'login': 'andronat', 'id': 793408, 'node_id': 'MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzQwOA==', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793408?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/andronat', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'user_view_type': 'public', 'site_admin': False}, 'assignees': [{'login': 'andronat', 'id': 793408, 'node_id': 'MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzQwOA==', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793408?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/andronat', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/andronat/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'user_view_type': 'public', 'site_admin': False}], 'milestone': None, 'comments': 3, 'created_at': '2022-07-24T11:57:01Z', 'updated_at': '2022-07-25T12:27:50Z', 'closed_at': '2022-07-25T12:27:49Z', 'author_association': 'CONTRIBUTOR', 'sub_issues_summary': {'total': 0, 'completed': 0, 'percent_completed': 0}, 'active_lock_reason': None, 'draft': False, 'pull_request': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/pulls/88', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/srg-imperial/SaBRe/pull/88', 'diff_url': 'https://github.com/srg-imperial/SaBRe/pull/88.diff', 'patch_url': 'https://github.com/srg-imperial/SaBRe/pull/88.patch', 'merged_at': '2022-07-25T12:27:49Z'}, 'body': ""This PR modifies `clone_syscall` and `clone3_syscall` signatures to accept context argument (one `void *`). This context argument can then be accessed from the post clone hook.\r\n\r\nThe implementation uses `xmm0` as a vehicle to pass the context argument to the child. The assumption is that it's unlikely libc `clone()` wrappers or other `clone()` users will depend on the value of `xmm0` in the child thread. `xmm0` value is set to NaN (ff bit pattern) after `post_clone_hook` exits, which should allow us to catch some instances of that not being the case.\r\n\r\nParent can use `xmm0` freely, as we save its value on `clone_syscall` /`clone3_syscall` function entry.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not make SaBRe any less stable. For example, if the client depends on the `rbx` value in the child, it will get corrupted, as exit path for `clone_syscall` bypasses normal register restore procedure, so the assumption that the child will just call the callback and do nothing else is already there."", 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/srg-imperial/SaBRe/issues/88/reactions', 'total_count': 1, '+1': 0, '-1': 0,

I'm struggling to get it to work and I'm wondering if there's a problem I can help diagnose, or whether I'm doing something wrong.\n\nI've tried running this on our Apple TV 3.2 from my M2 MacBook Air running OS X 14.6.1.\n\nI discovered in some other issue that it's important to update/restore the TV  using Finder, so I did that first.\n\nI ran the Jailbreak, and it popped up the message saying it was time to plug it into HDMI and would automatically reboot. I unplugged the USB cable, plugged the HDMI cable in, but when it booted up I saw this.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f74c02c6-a747-4785-8609-4c2c869d3b59)\n\nThis felt to me like it hadn't worked, but I left it for a while, perhaps half an hour, hoping something was happening in the background. Eventually the HDMI just goes blank. The light on the Apple TV is pulsing.\n\nI gave up in the end and hit Menu+Play which seemed to reboot it. I saw an Apple logo and it booted up as normal.\n\nI'm assuming that, once it works, you don't see the Apple Logo or regular menu, but it boots straight into Kodi?\n\nAny clues as to what I might be doing wrong, or how I could debug/diagnose it?"", 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/169/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/169/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None, 'score': 1.0}]",https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x,68.0,False,"[{'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/160', 'repository_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x', 'labels_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/160/labels{/name}', 'comments_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/160/comments', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/160/events', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/160', 'id': 2267029860, 'node_id': 'I_kwDOFuAgUM6HICFk', 'number': 160, 'title': 'Unable to be opened at a M1 Macbook Pro ', 'user': {'login': 'hpware', 'id': 157942818, 'node_id': 'U_kgDOCWoEIg', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157942818?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/hpware', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/hpware/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'user_view_type': 'public', 'site_admin': False}, 'labels': [], 'state': 'closed', 'locked': False, 'assignee': None, 'assignees': [], 'milestone': None, 'comments': 4, 'created_at': '2024-04-27T14:03:27Z', 'updated_at': '2024-07-01T01:56:43Z', 'closed_at': '2024-07-01T01:56:43Z', 'author_association': 'NONE', 'sub_issues_summary': {'total': 0, 'completed': 0, 'percent_completed': 0}, 'active_lock_reason': None, 'body': 'I tried opening old versions of the software in the release tab.

Summary:**\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses a potential memory leak in the `load_model` function by ensuring that the dynamically allocated memory for 'model' is properly deallocated before returning `NULL` in case of a model loading failure. Additionally, it includes changes to the `convert-hf-to-ggml.py` script to improve its readability and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Changes Made:**\r\n\r\n- Added memory deallocation for 'model' before returning `NULL` in case of a model loading failure.\r\n- Utilized the `delete` operator to release the dynamically allocated memory.\r\n- Removed a few unnecessary semicolons from the `convert-hf-to-ggml.py` script to enhance code readability and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Explanation:**\r\n\r\nThe `load_model` function previously allocated memory for 'model' using the `new` operator but didn't release it in case the model loading failed, potentially causing a memory leak. To address this issue, I added a `delete model;` statement before returning `NULL` when the loading fails.\r\n\r\nIn the `convert-hf-to-ggml.py` script, I removed a few semicolons that were not required for proper code execution. This change enhances the code's readability and maintains consistency with Python's coding style."", 'reactions': {'url':

works within the aggressor script:\r\n\r\n- The prependBytes call is happening before the modification of the MZ header. As a result, the first 4 bytes prepended will always be overwritten\r\n- When calling prependBytes, it seems to be breaking something within the way BokuLoader works, which results to the original reflective loader being loaded. For this one, not entirely sure why it happens as the code running after it doesn\'t seem to affect it.\r\n\r\n## How to replicate the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Edit BokuLoader.cna\r\n2. Go to line 1032 and uncomment the call to prependBytes\r\n3. Go to line 431 and add 4 characters at the start of the $Nops variable (e.g. ""AAAAPS[X""). This is due to the fact that they will be overwritten by the magic_mz\r\n4. Compile and load the Agressor Script on CS\r\n5. Create a Payload with the prepended bytes\r\n6. Check the binary created for the existence of the original reflective loader (simplest way is to run the YARA rule for the Windows_Trojan_Cobaltsrike indicator by Elastic:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_CobaltStrike.yar\r\n\r\n### Example output before and after uncommenting prepend:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/boku7/BokuLoader/assets/7713506/f1e2bb0f-5ca3-4bfb-9a4a-cf7c0c9d766c)\r\n', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/26/reactions', 'total_count': 1, '+1': 1, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/26/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None, 'score': 1.0}]",https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader,11.0,False,"[{'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/35', 'repository_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader', 'labels_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/35/labels{/name}', 'comments_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/35/comments', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/35/events', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/35', 'id': 2104351592, 'node_id': 'I_kwDOF6FO7859bdto', 'number': 35, 'title': 'executable error 0xc00000005', 'user': {'login': 'chenser9', 'id': 44432772, 'node_id': 'MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDMyNzcy', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44432772?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/chenser9', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/chenser9/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'user_view_type': 'public', 'site_admin': False}, 'labels': [], 'state': 'closed', 'locked': True, 'assignee': None, 'assignees': [], 'milestone': None, 'comments': 3, 'created_at': '2024-01-28T21:17:46Z', 'updated_at': '2024-02-04T23:12:07Z', 'closed_at': '2024-02-04T23:12:07Z', 'author_association': 'NONE', 'sub_issues_summary': {'total': 0, 'completed': 0, 'percent_completed': 0}, 'active_lock_reason': None, 'body': 'Hi!

BokuLoader is a great example of how to implement your UDRL properly.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if it is officially supported, but I would like to contribute a few minor string replacements for DNS, SMB and TCP beacons as an example. We are simply replacing one static signature with another here, just like in the HTTPS beacon example.

am experiencing an issue with connecting from Linux to Windows via a UDS tunnel RDP. My reference machine is in a domain, and I want to be able to select a domain user during the connection, but this does not happen as it does in Linux-Linux and Win-Win combinations (where an authorization window appears). I understand that it is possible to set up the connection and enter the domain user's credentials in advance, but then I would need to create a separate connection in UDS for each such domain user.\r\n\r\nIn my case, the authorization window simply does not appear, and I do not have the option to enter the domain user's credentials.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nBest

I\'m just trying to get a basic working example, and worry about secure implementation later. \r\n\r\n```\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <time.h>\r\n\r\nvoid sss_create_shares(sss_Share *out, const unsigned char *data, uint8_t n, uint8_t k)\r\n{\r\n        srand(time(NULL));\r\n\tunsigned char key[32];\r\n        int val;\r\n\tunsigned char m[crypto_secretbox_ZEROBYTES + sss_MLEN] = { 0 };\r\n\tunsigned long long mlen = sizeof(m); /* length includes zero-bytes */\r\n\tunsigned char c[mlen];\r\n\tint tmp;\r\n\tsss_Keyshare keyshares[n];\r\n\tsize_t idx;\r\n\r\n\t/* Generate a random encryption key */\r\n\t//randombytes(key, sizeof(key));\r\n       \r\n       //generate a key with a different method\r\n       for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++){\r\n             val = rand();  \r\n              key[i] = val;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnd I\'m calling `sss_create_shares` like so: \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nsss_Share shares[2];\r\nuint8_t data[sss_MLEN]\r\nstrncpy(data, ""hello"", sizeof(data));\r\nsss_create_shares(shares, data, 2, 2);\r\n\r\nfor(int i = 0; i < sizeof(shares[0]); i++){\r\n    Serial.println(shares[0][i]);\r\n    Serial.println(shares[1][i]);\r\n    Serial.println("""");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe output shows that the shares are exactly the same, except the beginning few characters. The output of the above code looks like (all values at the same idx are the same, except first bits): \r\n\r\n```\r\n93\r\n93\r\n\r\n236\r\n236\r\n\r\n153\r\n153\r\n... \r\n```\r\n\r\nI\'m stuck at this point and was hoping for some hint about how it\'s possible the shares come out pretty much exactly the same. I\'ve a feeling it\'s because of how I\'m making the `key` in `sss_create_shares`\r\n\r\nEDIT: I ended up using [this](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir) library and it works great',

(more to come)\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to replace #265, or at least provide an alternative to it, for comparison by reviewer(s).  I personally consider this version nicer/cleaner.\r\n\r\nHere we impl a custom NodeBuilder that is more ergonomic for the caller than the version derived by derive_builder.  \r\n\r\nThe [builder pattern](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-rust-api-builder-pattern/) by its very nature involves some boilerplate with the setters, so there's no getting around that, but I've tried to keep it as simple as possible. \r\n\r\nI considered putting NodeBuilder inside node.rs, but my reasoning is that node.rs is already quite large, and using a dedicated builder.rs we are able to remove a bit of code from it, rather than add to.\r\n\r\nI included the previous commit that uses derive_builder to generate NodeBuilder, because I figure we might want to go back to it at some point, if derive_builder crate ever supports custom/transient properties as [I requested](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kindelia-Chain/pull/265#issuecomment-1363222644).\r\n\r\nI provided some basic doc-comments for the builder.  Those more familiar with the codebase may wish to flesh the docs out more.\r\n\r\nIf the builder approach is deemed too heavy, then I guess the alternative is to use the pre-existing Node::new() except it must return a Result.  I am willing to do that, but I do find this approach more flexible and pleasing.  :-)\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\ncommit message:\r\n\r\nImplements NodeBuilder which provides more ergonomic usage for callers\r\nthan the derive_builder version, and also keeps Node clean without\r\na lot of derive_builder annotations.\r\n\r\nbuilder.rs: new file added\r\n\r\nnode.rs:\r\n    * remove derive_builder annotations\r\n    * remove NodeBuilder impl\r\n    * remove ParseError variant from BlockBodyError\r\n    * add comment that Node should be built with NodeBuilder\r\n\r\nutil.rs\r\n    * make EpochError pub.

From what I've been reading the last couple evenings, you can request a free 90 day trial period. But what happens after that? Does it stop working?\r\nAre the alternative options I see online legal to use? Or should I fear for lawsuits or settlement offers from Nvidia if I use vGPU without paying for the license?\r\n\r\nIn short, I'd like to setup 2 PC's at work (with 1 GPU each) with Proxmox and 2 Windows VM's each that can use the GPU on the host for CAD software via RDP. So 4 VM's in total using 2 GPUs.\r\n\r\nShould I just abandon this idea now and just buy 2 more cheap GPU's (the CAD software runs more than fine on an old GTX730) and use regular passthrough to each VM? It seems the Nvidia vGPU licenses are much more expensive than just getting 2 more GTX730s or similar. And even with paying for the license, could they still come after our company for using the vGPU-unlock?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"", 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/128/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/128/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None, 'score': 1.0}]",https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock,64.0,False,"[{'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/114', 'repository_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock', 'labels_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/114/labels{/name}', 'comments_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/114/comments', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/114/events', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/114', 'id': 1567431633, 'node_id': 'I_kwDOE-csR85dbRvR', 'number': 114, 'title': 'PCIe Bus Error on 2080Ti', 'user': {'login': 'XCBOSA', 'id': 20897243, 'node_id': 'MDQ6VXNlcjIwODk3MjQz', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20897243?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/XCBOSA', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/XCBOSA/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'user_view_type': 'public', 'site_admin': False}, 'labels': [], 'state': 'closed', 'locked': False, 'assignee': None, 'assignees': [], 'milestone': None, 'comments': 1, 'created_at': '2023-02-02T06:44:57Z', 'updated_at': '2023-02-02T15:30:10Z', 'closed_at': '2023-02-02T15:30:10Z', 'author_association': 'NONE', 'sub_issues_summary': {'total': 0, 'completed': 0, 'percent_completed': 0}, 'active_lock_reason': None, 'body': ""Hello, I can successfully install the driver in the virtual machine, but when I use a stressful graphics program (such as Furmark) in the virtual machine, the host freezes and keeps showing\r\n\r\n```\r\nPCIe Bus Error: severity=Uncorrected (Fatal), type=Transaction Layer, (Receiver ID)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the filesystem becomes read-only mode and I can't view the logs.

Unet model for semantic segmentation. I pass a batch of images to the model. The model is expected to output 0 or 1 for each pixel of the image (depending upon whether pixel is part of person object or not). 0 is for background, and 1 is for foreground.\r\n\r\nI am trying to quantize the Unet model with Pytorch quantization apis for ARM architecture. I chose Qnnpack as quantization configuration. However the model accuracy is very poor for both Post training static quantization as well as QAT. The output is always a complete black image i.e. contains only background, no foreground for the person object. The model outputs bX2X224X224 i.e. batch_size X 2 channels (one for forground and one for background) X height X width.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the output values for the center pixels of images - with original model and with quantized model.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32384197/90606892-15bfa980-e21e-11ea-8109-5207a759ff82.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs seen, the original model has varying output values. Hence when we apply Softmax on dim=1 (i,e, Channel dimension), we get some pixels as 0 and some as 1. This is as per expectation. However, the quantized model always outputs high positive for background and high negative for foreground channel. After applying softmax, all the pixels are background pixels, and the output is black images.\r\n\r\nI need some help to find why this is happening. Is it a bug in qnnpack quantization routine?\r\n\r\nThe model source code is available at [here](https://github.com/thuyngch/Human-Segmentation-PyTorch). I used pretrained version of  Unet with MobileNetV2 as backbone (check benchmark section in the readme from the source code link) - [see here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17GZLCi_FHhWo4E4wPobbLAQdBZrlqVnF/view).\r\n\r\nI first tried with Fbgemm configuration, and it worked fine in terms of accuracy - no major loss. However, when tried with qnnpack, I face above issues.

Hence before this layer, we need to dequantize tensors, apply nn.ConvTranspose2d, and then requantize for subsequent layers. Can this be reason for lower accuracy?\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n#   Decoder

Summary:
Clamping should be ideally tightly bound to [output_min, output_min] or [output_max, output_max].
This fails in testing when zero_point is set to 255 which is possible when all values are negative.

Fix clamp operator to work when output_min == output_max. (#65)

Summary:
Clamping should be ideally tightly bound to [output_min, output_min] or [output_max, output_max].
This fails in testing when zero_point is set to 255 which is possible when all values are negative.

Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine)\r\n\r\nA few months ago, we built the open source [GraphQL Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) that gives you instant GraphQL APIs over any Postgres database. We have added all of Skor's existing features and even more to make it production ready:\r\n\r\n 1) Reliable: We capture every relevant action on the database as an event, even when Hasura is down! The events are delivered to your webhook as soon as possible with an atleast-once guarantee.\r\n\r\n2) Scalable: What more, it even scales horizontally. If you are processing millions of events, just add more instances of GraphQL engine.\r\n\r\n3) Use with Serverless: If you are using Skor, then avoid the pain of managing your webhook by moving to Serverless infrastructure. Check out these blog posts to get started\r\n\r\n**Use [Hasura GraphQL Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) for production use cases** "", 'reactions': {'url':

The HRAP shows up as an Xbox 360 controller on PC, a console the firmware doesn't support as far as I'm aware, so I'm wondering if this is an issue with the xinput/dinput/console settings - could you please let me know how to switch between these without opening up the stick, if possible? I've tried uninstalling the device on my PC and seeing if I can get it to register as a generic controller instead, but this didn't help. Is there anything else I can try? (I'm completely unfamiliar with GP2040 itself, but would be up for reinstalling it and doing some tinkering if necessary - please point me in the right direction!)\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your

folks,\r\n\r\nI'm the author of axum-sessions, which is a crate I see you all are using--I'm glad to see you've found it useful!\r\n\r\nOver the course of the last year or so we've hit some roadblocks with our key dependency, async-session. The long and short of that is in order to unblock that and address some problems with axum-sessions's design, we've released a new crate which aims to replace axum-sessions: [tower-sessions](https://github.com/maxcountryman/tower-sessions).\r\n\r\ntower-sessions no longer relies on a third-party crate for its session implementation and this has allowed us to change its design to better fit tower and the broader tower ecosystem (i.e. axum). For instance, we no longer need writable and readable sessions, and have simplified the interface as a result.\r\n\r\nI'd be curious if there's interest in migrating and am happy to help if so."",

range?\r\n\r\nscenario:\r\nThe lower tones are bigger therefore has wider hand movement range while the high tones are getting closer and closer and are harder to play as the distance between them is getting smaller.\r\nWhat would be useful would be to have a chance to alter the values so that the lower tones are closer than are by default and the higher tones are further form one another than are by default.\r\nIt might be on a software side as function that would adjust the incoming pitch value by a factor value, the value distribution\r\n\r\npython example\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as

existing test to fail,\nbut this is primarily because it makes it test slightly different scenario, which is already failing today.\n\nI don\'t know how to cleanly fix it, so instead I have first added a second testcase exposing the current problem and then commented out both testcases with a FIXME.\n\nI also have a couple more branches: ""experiment"" with the original commits. The code in that branch can successfully process (minus the variadic macros) a ~50K line .h tree, including the standard includes and custom includes from VPP.\n\nAnother branch ""new"" is hopefully other candidates that might be interesting for you to include (I would definitely like to be able to have a search path, for example - and maybe the collection of corner-case tests could be also useful, though I don\'t know yet how to wrap it into proper tests).\n\nWill be off for two weeks for vacation, so will be slower with replies / less capable in terms of corrections in the code.
