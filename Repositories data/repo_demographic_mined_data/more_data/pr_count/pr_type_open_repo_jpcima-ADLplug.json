Looks like it is required only to reduce `juce_audio_utils`, so I only removed the hack around (`ex` namespace) and simply added the module to the build as I don't see the reason why it had better be cut. If there is any way to preserve it to still compile fine, then I would bring it back, I do not stick to it.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/93/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jpcima/ADLplug/issues/93/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
