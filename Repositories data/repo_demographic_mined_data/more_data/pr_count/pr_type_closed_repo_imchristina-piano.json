It's not pretty, but it works.\r\n\r\nIn your code, you basically have one \"string\" (with its own single \"state\"), and you're filling the buffer like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLeft:   0  1  2  3  4  5 ...\r\nRight: 90 91 92 93 94 95 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of that, I made it mono and filled the buffer like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLeft:   0  1  2  3  4  5 ...\r\nRight:  0  1  2  3  4  5 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the numbers are the sample number (i.e. the X-th sample out of `update`)\r\n\r\nbecause I was calling `update` 1/2 the times you were, I fixed it by simply throwing away a sample in each iteration of the loop.
