I'm working on a master's degree right now and focusing on automatic synthesizer programming - so your work on this and the other work you have published on deep learning for synthesizer programming has been extremely helpful! \r\n\r\nI tracked down a bit of an issue with the way that midi notes are being added to the buffer. Timestamps in MidiMessages are ignored in the [MidiBuffer.addEvent method](https://docs.juce.com/master/classMidiBuffer.html#aee453648cab2b625eb222c40ec5fc37f) (this is true for v5.2.0 as well). This is causing midi notes to be triggered on every buffer iteration. This is also occurring for the note off MidiMessages once they begin to be triggered (less of an issue, but since the timestamp is being used, the message isn't being triggered on the correct sample). \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by ensuring that only one note on MidiMessage is sent during the first buffer, and then the note off MidiMessage is being set to the correct sample in the buffer.\r\n\r\nHere is a waveform test rendering of a sine wave with no amplitude envelope:\r\n \r\nbefore:\r\n![output_4_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4112059/78157912-724c3480-73f5-11ea-908c-6cdd9ce286a9.png)\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4112059/78158007-94de4d80-73f5-11ea-880a-e9398ad97e7f.png)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fedden/RenderMan/issues/18/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fedden/RenderMan/issues/18/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
