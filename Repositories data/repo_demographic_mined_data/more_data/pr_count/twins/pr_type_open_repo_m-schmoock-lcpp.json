The code in that branch can successfully process (minus the variadic macros) a ~50K line .h tree, including the standard includes and custom includes from VPP.\n\nAnother branch \"new\" is hopefully other candidates that might be interesting for you to include (I would definitely like to be able to have a search path, for example - and maybe the collection of corner-case tests could be also useful, though I don't know yet how to wrap it into proper tests).\n\nWill be off for two weeks for vacation, so will be slower with replies / less capable in terms of corrections in the code. Anyway hopefully this is useful and matches what you'd expected.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/m-schmoock/lcpp/issues/26/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/m-schmoock/lcpp/issues/26/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
