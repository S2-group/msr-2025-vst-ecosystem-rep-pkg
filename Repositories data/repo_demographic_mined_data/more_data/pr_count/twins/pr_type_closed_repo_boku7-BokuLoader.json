BokuLoader is a great example of how to implement your UDRL properly.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it is officially supported, but I would like to contribute a few minor string replacements for DNS, SMB and TCP beacons as an example. We are simply replacing one static signature with another here, just like in the HTTPS beacon example. I preserved the original \"bacon\" style of the project.\r\n\r\nE.g. 64-bit TCP beacon shell code would now contain:\r\nbacon.x64.bacons.dll\r\n\r\ninstead of:\r\npivot.x64.rl100k.dll\r\n\r\nFeel free to accept or decline as you see fit. Keep up the great work!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n0xbad53c", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/33/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/boku7/BokuLoader/issues/33/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
