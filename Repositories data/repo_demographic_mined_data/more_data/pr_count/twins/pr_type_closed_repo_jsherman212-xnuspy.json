Since I have not had the ability to test these patches on other devices they may require some fine tuning, but I have tried to write them in a way which is fairly flexible. The main issue I ran into was patchsets such as \"proc stuff\" searched for calls within `proc_self`, which in assembly now looks completely different on iOS 15 than in previous versions (almost all of the calls are inlined). \r\nI also added an additional patchfind for `IOLog` -- this is useful to have access to if you're debugging with a UART/serial cable such as Kanzi or Kong, as you can get kernel serial output when booting with `-v serial=3` bootargs (this output includes log messages from `IOLog`).\r\n\r\nI had to remove calls to `proc_{ref,rele}_locked` in `xnuspy_gc_thread`, as these functions are no longer present in the iOS 15 kernel. I suspect this will cause instability when using a large number of hooks or running xnuspy from a large number of processes. However, I have not found any such instability during my usage so far.\r\n\r\nI also moved `proc_list_unlock` to its own separate function which uses `lck_mtx_unlock` on `proc_list_mlockp`, as similar to `proc_list_lock` in previous versions, this function is only ever inlined by it's callers on iOS 15.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where I was able to update iOS 13 and 14 patchfinders without having to write a new one for 15, however I have been unable to test these patches on 15.\r\n\r\nI also added a new wrapper for `vm_map_unwire`, as `vm_map_unwire` had to be replaced with `vm_map_unwire_nested` on iOS 15. Functionality wise this is still identical. \r\n\r\nThere may be some extraneous comments and log messages which still need tidying, however I wanted to share this PR as a solid base to work from. \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jsherman212/xnuspy/issues/5/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jsherman212/xnuspy/issues/5/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
