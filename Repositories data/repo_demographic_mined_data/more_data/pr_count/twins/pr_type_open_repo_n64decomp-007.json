The BMP files can then be individually viewed in a standard image viewing program, such as GIMP.\r\n\r\nThe raw 8-bit image data is extracted from the baserom.u.z64 file by the extract_baserom.u.sh file, using the offsets inserted into the filelist.u.csv file.\r\n\r\nThe extract_baserom.u.sh file then inserts a generic 8-bit greyscale BMP header file (font_bmp_header.bin) to the beginning of each image file using the 'sed' command, and then updates the image width and height values in the BMP header according to the values at the end of each filename.\r\n\r\nThe height is adjusted to a negative value, so that the bitmap will be displayed the correct way up. The filesize and imagesize fields of the BMP header are not modified (for simplicity) as GIMP seems to be able to open the images without them.\r\n\r\nThe BMP header data is ignored when assembling the image data, as the assets/font/font.s file contains instructions to ignore the first 1146 bytes of each BMP file.\r\n\r\nThe assets/font/font.s file also ensures that the 8 bytes of 'padding' data are added to the end of each 16-pixel-wide font. The padding data is only extracted once by the extract_baserom.u.sh file (instead of after each 16-pixel-wide image), as it appears to be identical in each subsequent 16-pixel-wide image.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n64decomp/007/issues/2/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/n64decomp/007/issues/2/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
