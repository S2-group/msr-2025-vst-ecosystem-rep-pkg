It is because the\r\nbuilding system of busybox uses the partial linking feature of ld\r\nwhile the afl-clang-fast cannot handle such case.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the building system of busybox first merges several\r\nrelocatable object file into a new relocatable file using the '-r'\r\noption, where the afl-llvm-rt.o added by afl-clang-fast is also merged,\r\nso the new relocatable file contains the symbols from afl-llvm-rt.o.\r\nAt the final linking step, the new relocatable file is linked with\r\nafl-llvm-rt.o (added again by afl-clang-fast) into the executable file,\r\nbut both files contain the definitions of the symbols from afl-llvm-rt.o.\r\nAs a result, the compiler complains that and stop the building process.\r\n\r\nI fix this by restraining afl-clang-fast from adding the 'afl-llvm-rt.o'\r\nparameter when seeing the '-r', '-Wl,-r', or '-Wl,-i' in the cmd line.\r\n\r\nI see that AFLplusplus handles partial linking just now, but it ignores the '-r'\r\nparameter though handling the '-Wl,-r' and '-Wl,-i'. Therefore, it still cannot\r\ncompile the busybox.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/AFL/issues/143/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/AFL/issues/143/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
