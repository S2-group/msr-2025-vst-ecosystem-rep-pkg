[ElusiveMice](https://github.com/mgeeky/ElusiveMice) ) that wants to patch _amsi.dll_, _wldp.dll_ in-memory. \r\n\r\nHaving launched `unhook` would restore our hooks denying previous intentions. To fix that, this PR adds optional parameters to the `unhook` command that define modules to be skipped during unhooking.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeacon> help unhook\r\nSynopsis: unhook [[skip-module1] [...
