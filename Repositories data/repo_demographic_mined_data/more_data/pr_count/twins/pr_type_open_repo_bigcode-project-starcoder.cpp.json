Additionally, it includes changes to the `convert-hf-to-ggml.py` script to improve its readability and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Changes Made:**\r\n\r\n- Added memory deallocation for 'model' before returning `NULL` in case of a model loading failure.\r\n- Utilized the `delete` operator to release the dynamically allocated memory.\r\n- Removed a few unnecessary semicolons from the `convert-hf-to-ggml.py` script to enhance code readability and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Explanation:**\r\n\r\nThe `load_model` function previously allocated memory for 'model' using the `new` operator but didn't release it in case the model loading failed, potentially causing a memory leak. To address this issue, I added a `delete model;` statement before returning `NULL` when the loading fails.\r\n\r\nIn the `convert-hf-to-ggml.py` script, I removed a few semicolons that were not required for proper code execution. This change enhances the code's readability and maintains consistency with Python's coding style.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bigcode-project/starcoder.cpp/issues/34/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bigcode-project/starcoder.cpp/issues/34/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
