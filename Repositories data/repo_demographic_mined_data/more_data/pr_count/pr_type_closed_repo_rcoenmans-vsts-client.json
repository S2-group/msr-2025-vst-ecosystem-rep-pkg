This is useful when developing to know what are is the API range to be used (for example, comment access by revision has been introduced in version 3.0, removed after version 5.0 and does not support updating or deleting comment; after version 5.0, comment are accessed by ID and can be updating and removed). This could be useful, in the future, to choose, at runtime, between different possible API endpoint, the best one available on the server.\r\nRegards,\r\nColin\r\nPS.: I'm still working on comment management.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcoenmans/vsts-client/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rcoenmans/vsts-client/issues/6/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
