After playing around with it for a long time, I have finally concluded that it would be best to do away with this section of the menu and institute the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Naked scroll always pans left/right (or up/down, if the user wants)\r\n- Ctrl zooms horizontally\r\n- Shift zooms vertically (shift is _above_ ctrl, making it seem more \"vertical\")\r\n- Alt zooms globally (makes sense)\r\n\r\nTraditionally, shift/ctrl/alt scroll always relates to zooming, while naked scroll relates to panning. I think this is the way it should be in Helio as well.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/helio-fm/helio-workstation/issues/254/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/helio-fm/helio-workstation/issues/254/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
