I found this project in a NuGet gallery (https://www.nuget.org/packages/KDISim.CheckConsolidate), tried to use it in VSTS as instructed, but noticed it was failing to break the build. Seems that in its current form, CheckConsolidate does not return an exit code, nor does it write to error console in order to allow VSTS build tasks to use its output. Below is an attempt to address that issue.
