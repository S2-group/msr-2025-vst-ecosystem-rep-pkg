Upgraded to 2.5.0 but problem was still there.  Reviewed commits and I think I might see the problem in NewWorkItem.cs (2.5.0+2840.2):\r\n\r\n```        \r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Specifies the area path of the work item.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        [Parameter]\r\n        [WorkItemField(\"System.IterationPath\", FieldType.TreePath)]\r\n        public string AreaPath { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Specifies the iteration path of the work item.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        [Parameter]\r\n        [WorkItemField(\"System.AreaPath\", FieldType.TreePath)]\r\n        public string IterationPath { get; set; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless I'm misreading the code, it looks like the WorkItemField declarations are reversed.  Looking back at 2.4.1+2827.1, I see a similar issue that would explain the problem I originally saw in 2.4.1.\r\n\r\nI'm not setup to test and contribute a fix, but I did downgrade to 2.4.0 and found the problem with New-TfsWorkItem goes away.  So, hopefully, this is helpful enough info to make the fix easy.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/191/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/igoravl/TfsCmdlets/issues/191/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
