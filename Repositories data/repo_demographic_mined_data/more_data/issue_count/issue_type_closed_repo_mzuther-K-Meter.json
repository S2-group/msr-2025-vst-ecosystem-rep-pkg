This client _only_ has output ports, but is listed in the K-Meter output dropdown as opposed to the _input_ dropdown.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6024227/88955420-84ce6180-d261-11ea-877f-f7cc5d256145.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nList *all* steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Start K-Meter\r\n2. Set device type to 'JACK'\r\n3. Attempt to connect\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n'Output' and 'Input' client lists are swapped.\r\n\r\n### Environment (please complete the following information)\r\n\r\n - OS: Gentoo x86_64\r\n - Plugin (not really a plugin): Precompiled K-Meter standalone for stereo (sha256: `5b021e3f007a04749774bd994b538e56b1656ffb92ba418ae8eb6c9ab9806cb2  kmeter_stereo_x64`)\r\n - JACK version: JACK2 v1.9.14 (`jackdmp version 1.9.14 tmpdir /dev/shm protocol 8`)\r\n\r\nDid you compile K-Meter yourself? no, I don't want to deal with JUCE right now.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mzuther/K-Meter/issues/26/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mzuther/K-Meter/issues/26/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
