I have installed it as a step in my build pipeline. It creates a link to the badge which you can easily create yourself (on the badge.io).

Am I missed something?\r\nIt would be much more useful to generate the link to the badge once and have it updated every time the build passes (or fails), so the badge reflects the status.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chwebdude/BadgeCreator/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chwebdude/BadgeCreator/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
