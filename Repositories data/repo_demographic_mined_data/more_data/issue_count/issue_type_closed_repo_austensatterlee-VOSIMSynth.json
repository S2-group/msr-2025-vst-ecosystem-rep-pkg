I tried both versions, the 32bit as well as 64bit. I did not build it myself but instead downloaded the latest (.dll) releases. Is this project still maintained somehow because I saw that it wasnt updated in almost 3 years if I m not mistaken.\r\n\r\nAre there any working releases somewhere?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMichael", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/austensatterlee/VOSIMSynth/issues/8/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/austensatterlee/VOSIMSynth/issues/8/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
