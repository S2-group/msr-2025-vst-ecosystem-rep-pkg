And also as introduction.\r\n\r\nBasically, the LV2 plugin category should be set as Delay.\r\nI can send some pull requests for these small details, alternatively I can write a small list if you prefer to do them yourself.\r\n\r\nThanks again", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/davemollen/dm-GrainDelay/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/davemollen/dm-GrainDelay/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
