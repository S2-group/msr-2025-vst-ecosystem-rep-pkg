And it looks like your Client type should not ask to provide Project parameter at the constructor (NewClient method) because there are [several APIs|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/core/] which don't require projects at all. And it looks more consistent to pass Project only when you want to work with exact one project.\r\n\r\nSo right now Client describes a class for working with just one project but maybe it would be useful to have a separate type which will work with Azure DevOps in general and will be able to return your current \"project\" client.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/benmatselby/go-azuredevops/issues/30/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/benmatselby/go-azuredevops/issues/30/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
