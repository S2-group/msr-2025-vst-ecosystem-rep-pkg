I typically just use the report server interface to upload reports to a specific SSRS folder. Is your configuration file based on any standard SSRS built in config file required by the report server end point , http://servername:8080/ReportServer/ReportService2010.asmx ? I am trying to test your task on my end using an agent on my machine. I loaded both the report and your config file on Azure devops git repo. I have not attempted to modify your sample config file yet. Currently I am getting the following error when i run the pipeline.\r\n\r\n2022-06-09T15:31:50.3913455Z ##[error]Provided files folder path C:\\agent\\_work\\r2\\a\\SSRS Source\\test.rdl is not valid.\r\n\r\nI am sure the path to the report is correct. It was downloaded by my agent. Am I getting this error because I did not modify your config file ? Can you please advise on what needs to be changed or point me to more documentation ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mmajcica/DeploySsrs/issues/81/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mmajcica/DeploySsrs/issues/81/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
