I didn't know any way to contact you, so I thought I'd ask here.\r\n\r\nWith Ubuntu Studio transitioning to KDE Plasma, and with the KDE integration this application has, I figured it would be a perfect fit to be included in Ubuntu Studio. There are a number of people who use Ubuntu Studio professionally in both live and recorded performances, so something like this would be a perfect fit.\r\n\r\nHowever, I noticed your last release is over 3 years old. Is this project abandoned? Reason for the question is that it's incredibly difficult to package an application and distribute it when there's no upstream support. When new versions of the underlying structure change (KDE Frameworks updates, Carla updates, etc.) bugs can get introduced.\r\n\r\nMy question is if you have any interest in updating this project further? To me, it seems like it has a lot of potential, and I'd rather not see something like this die. I'm not a programmer and have a lot on my plate already, so adopting a project like this is out of the question for me, but I wanted to see where you were at to gauge whether or not I should attempt packaging in Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/progwolff/performer/issues/1/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/progwolff/performer/issues/1/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
