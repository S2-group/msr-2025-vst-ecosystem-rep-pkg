Jokes aside I've decided to finally test it in ardour and basically it don't work, when active the plugin actually mutes the audio, the impression it gives is that the generated samples in the plugin are not being sent to the audio output.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open an ardour session\r\n2. Add a midi track\r\n3. Add roboverb lv2 after the sound source (synth plugin or whatever, in my case I've used surge)\r\n4. When roboverb is active there's no sound, bypass it and sound is back\r\n\r\nAs before I'm using Pop_OS! 20.10, Ardour 6.6 running JACK with 96k and 1024 as buffer, I can't test if It's a bug with the sampling rate because my motherboard soundcard basically don't allow me to use anything below 96k, so I can only ask to also test this. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsULVtEONBM) showing the problem.\r\n\r\n<bountysource-plugin>\r\n\r\n---\r\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://app.bountysource.com/issues/97345540-lv2-version-no-sound-in-ardour?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F147733580&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://app.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F147733580&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\r\n</bountysource-plugin>", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kushview/roboverb/issues/16/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kushview/roboverb/issues/16/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
