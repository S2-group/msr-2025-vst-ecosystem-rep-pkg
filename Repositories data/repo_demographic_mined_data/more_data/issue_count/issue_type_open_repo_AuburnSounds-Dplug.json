Need clean break for `Vec!T`, which can only grow.\r\n`ringbuf.d` should probably go, too specific\r\n- `stackallocator.d` was never used anywhere I guess\r\n- `thread.d` and `sync.d` or kinda okay, but could report error code, and should be able to cancel\r\n- `binrange.d` I don't like that. Would prefer a library that does endianness read and write, on a simple pointer rather than range.\r\n`file.d` well it kinda work I guess. I'd rather have Stream interface a-la `FILE*`\r\n- `runtime.d` I want to remove this, never worked properly.\r\n\r\nThen we would split `dplug:core` and kill that package.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AuburnSounds/Dplug/issues/795/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AuburnSounds/Dplug/issues/795/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
