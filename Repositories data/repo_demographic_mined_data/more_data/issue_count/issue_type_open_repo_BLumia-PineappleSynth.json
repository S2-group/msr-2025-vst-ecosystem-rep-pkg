It should be improved to make accessing properties of voices and adding new attributes easier.\r\nSeveral points that should be taken into consideration:\r\n- The full list of attributes is still determined at compile time. There's no need to be completely dynamic.\r\n- Avoid using std::map or anything like that in audio processing. They can be used to bind UI elements with attributes, however.\r\n- For the sake of performance, consider setting up a union for all attributes, store them in an array and access with predefined attribute-name-to-subscript mapping macros.
