But when I read the paper and test the code, I found some problems. Here are my questions.\r\n\r\n1.  In section 6.5.3, your test results showed a significant performance degrade(24M/280K) when indexes do no fit in RAM. How did you test the performance of KVell in different RAM sizes? It's mentioned in the paper that the B tree data is allocated from an mmap-ed file. Did you use mmap-ed file as the paper said or just flush indexes to the swap? Is the mmap-ed file or swap configured on NVMe SSD? Since the performance degration is obvious, I'd like to know the reason.\r\n\r\n2. When I tested the code, I found that every time I tested, I needed to delete the data and reinitalize, otherwise I wound get an error like this.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24471884/84127853-56f34a80-aa72-11ea-8f9e-0beb5326d63f.png)\r\nIs this a bug in the code? How did you test the recover time?\r\n\r\n3.  Figure 5 shows that rocksdb reached  800KOps/s under YCSB-C workload with zipfian key distribution. When I tested rocksdb with YCSB, it did not seem to achieve such high throughput., so I was wondering how you configured rocksdb and compared it to KVell. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply.
