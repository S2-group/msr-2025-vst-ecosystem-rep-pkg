This is a problem if the compiler puts secret at a lower address than array1, which is the case on my Mac (the offset calculation in main will make malicious_x and therefore x negative).  In this case, the program doesn't actually demonstrate a spectre attack.  The fix would be to check that x is both greater than or equal to zero and less than array1_size.  I'm not sure how to do that without causing branching (I guess that using && must cause branching because of short-circuiting and will mess up branch prediction.  Would something like \"...int test = x < array1_size; test &= x >= 0; if(test) ...\" work?).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Eugnis/spectre-attack/issues/22/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Eugnis/spectre-attack/issues/22/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
