I would like to see intel syntax and I also think it would be easier to implement, but obviously that's up to you.\r\n* Justify the current line number to the left when `relativenumbers=1`. For example in vim it's displayed like this, and I think it is more readable (of course you could just add an option to toggle justify):\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29655971/218311701-3eee3664-29f2-4743-885a-6377276eafb0.png)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/klange/bim/issues/32/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/klange/bim/issues/32/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
