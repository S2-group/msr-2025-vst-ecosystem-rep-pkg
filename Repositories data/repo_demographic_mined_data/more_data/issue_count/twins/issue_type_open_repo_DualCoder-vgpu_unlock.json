From what I've been reading the last couple evenings, you can request a free 90 day trial period. But what happens after that? Does it stop working?\r\nAre the alternative options I see online legal to use? Or should I fear for lawsuits or settlement offers from Nvidia if I use vGPU without paying for the license?\r\n\r\nIn short, I'd like to setup 2 PC's at work (with 1 GPU each) with Proxmox and 2 Windows VM's each that can use the GPU on the host for CAD software via RDP. So 4 VM's in total using 2 GPUs.\r\n\r\nShould I just abandon this idea now and just buy 2 more cheap GPU's (the CAD software runs more than fine on an old GTX730) and use regular passthrough to each VM? It seems the Nvidia vGPU licenses are much more expensive than just getting 2 more GTX730s or similar. And even with paying for the license, could they still come after our company for using the vGPU-unlock?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/128/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock/issues/128/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
