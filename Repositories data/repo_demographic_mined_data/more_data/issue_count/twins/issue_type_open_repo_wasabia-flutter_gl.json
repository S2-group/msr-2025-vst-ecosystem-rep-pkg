We need our model to rotate freely in 360\u00b0 in all directions without restrictions. Currently, the model rotates infinitely on the horizontal axis, but vertically, it is limited to 180\u00b0, causing the rotation to lock beyond that point.\r\n\r\nWhat we're aiming for is trackball-style movement, but right now, we only have turntable-style movement. We've been trying various methods to resolve this issue for the past 3 weeks without success, and we're feeling quite exhausted. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nLike this website has -- https://app.emb3d.com/3dviewer [View Point - Trackball]", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasabia/flutter_gl/issues/58/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/wasabia/flutter_gl/issues/58/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
