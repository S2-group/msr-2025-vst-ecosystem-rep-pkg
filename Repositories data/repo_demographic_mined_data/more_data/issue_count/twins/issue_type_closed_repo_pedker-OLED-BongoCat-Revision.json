It idles correctly, but on key presses goes straight to the Prep animation frame and stays there until it goes back to the idle. I can't for the life of me figure out why this could be and would really appreciate some help. This is my first time working with QMK and really programming at all so I am hoping its a really obvious error that you might be able to help me with.\r\n\r\nI have put my keymap here if you wouldn't mind taking a look, and a video of the problem as well.
