I'd like to at least enable keyboard support so I can get into the BIOS and see if there is anything in there I can disable other 'features' they have done to make life difficult for anyone trying to bypass their features.\r\n\r\nA lot of this is over my head.   I really want to learn more, but it can possibly take years for me to get up to speed.\r\n\r\nOn that note, are you available for hire to take a look and see what can possibly be done to make this system operate like a normal PC again?\r\n\r\nThe maker of the modular cpu design is Kontron.  \r\nThe cpu modules are made by Adastra\r\nThe BIOS is Phoenix\r\nOld Celeron CPU\r\n\r\nMany programs in BIOS...
