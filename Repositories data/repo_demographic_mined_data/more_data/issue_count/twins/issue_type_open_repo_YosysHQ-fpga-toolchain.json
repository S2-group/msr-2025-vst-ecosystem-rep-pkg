I wanted to make a suggestion regarding the following in the yices2 script:\r\n\r\n```# gperf files don't work with CRLF line endings on windows\r\n# TODO: handle this better so I don't mess with people's dev envs\r\ngit config --global core.autocrlf false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a Windows/mingw/cygwin user I definitely would not want my global git autocrlf changed. Maybe it would be possible to use `dos2unix` which at least on msys2 (mingw) can be installed easily (pacman -S dos2unix)?\r\n\r\nHope this helps -\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain/issues/81/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain/issues/81/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
