The HRAP shows up as an Xbox 360 controller on PC, a console the firmware doesn't support as far as I'm aware, so I'm wondering if this is an issue with the xinput/dinput/console settings - could you please let me know how to switch between these without opening up the stick, if possible? I've tried uninstalling the device on my PC and seeing if I can get it to register as a generic controller instead, but this didn't help. Is there anything else I can try? (I'm completely unfamiliar with GP2040 itself, but would be up for reinstalling it and doing some tinkering if necessary - please point me in the right direction!)\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!\r\n\r\nMike", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FeralAI/GP2040/issues/67/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FeralAI/GP2040/issues/67/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
