The system is brought to a halt, and pressing F5 doe resume it successfully, so it appears to be working behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nWorth noting that the frame buffer autodetection did not work, so I tried to input a width 1920, height 1080, and the address from Device Manager (there is two listed under Microsoft Basic Display Adapter and I tried both, neither worked), and stride 0. Saved changes and tried stopping/starting but no luck. Another observation is that pressing Autodetect after the drivers have started slows the system down to a crawl, where the cursor only updates every 5-10 seconds. (100% CPU usage?). The only escape from this is a reboot.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vitoplantamura/BugChecker/issues/11/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/vitoplantamura/BugChecker/issues/11/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
