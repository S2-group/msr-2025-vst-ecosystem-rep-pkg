When compiling `little` on Linux I noticed several issues here.\r\n\r\n1. Compatibility issues with `sprintf_s(...)`. This function only exists in Windows and the equivalent (for Unix-based systems) is `snprintf(...)`.  Windows do have `snprintf(...)` (see [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/snprintf-snprintf-snprintf-l-snwprintf-snwprintf-l?view=msvc-170)) so using that function reasonably increase compatibility between two systems. Another function, called `strncpy_s(...)` is again, Windows specific. However, `strncpy(...)` can do exactly the same job except it will not have `numberOfElements` param (which seems to me unreasonable and confusing to use).\r\n\r\n2. There are several areas in code, I saw casting is unreasonable and does a totally different job. Most of them are incompatible pointer casts and at line [349](https://github.com/Beariish/little/blob/1a64cbff67a3058311315d014b22ccf8bab46c3c/src/little.h#L349); it's representing pointer insider pointer and comparing or doing arithmetic work will yield invalid operands error. I'm not sure which compiler you've used that ignores this thing.
