My reference machine is in a domain, and I want to be able to select a domain user during the connection, but this does not happen as it does in Linux-Linux and Win-Win combinations (where an authorization window appears). I understand that it is possible to set up the connection and enter the domain user's credentials in advance, but then I would need to create a separate connection in UDS for each such domain user.\r\n\r\nIn my case, the authorization window simply does not appear, and I do not have the option to enter the domain user's credentials.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nWindorsort", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openxc/uds-c/issues/33/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openxc/uds-c/issues/33/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
