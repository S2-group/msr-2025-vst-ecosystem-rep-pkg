That way when I want to claim, \"this is what Python was like in 1991\", I can steer clear of any more modern changes that were made.\r\n\r\nIs that something you would be willing to prepare?\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration,\r\n\r\nG", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smontanaro/python-0.9.1/issues/6/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/smontanaro/python-0.9.1/issues/6/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
