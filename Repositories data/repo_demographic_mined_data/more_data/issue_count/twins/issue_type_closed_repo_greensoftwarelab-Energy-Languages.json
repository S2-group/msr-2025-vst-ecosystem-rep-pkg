There were many upgrades to this version over the years. I think using .NET 1.1 as C# can be misrepresenting because we can consider .NET Core 1.1 as an experimental version for cross-platform C# and there are many improvements made to .NET framework. The latest one is currently .NET 6. Performance is much better in the newer frameworks.\r\n\r\nI think using .NET 5 or .NET 6 will better represent C# community here.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDogac", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages/issues/28/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages/issues/28/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
