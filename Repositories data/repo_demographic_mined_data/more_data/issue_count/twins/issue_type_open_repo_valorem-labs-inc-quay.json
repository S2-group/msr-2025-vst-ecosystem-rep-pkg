The long and short of that is in order to unblock that and address some problems with axum-sessions's design, we've released a new crate which aims to replace axum-sessions: [tower-sessions](https://github.com/maxcountryman/tower-sessions).\r\n\r\ntower-sessions no longer relies on a third-party crate for its session implementation and this has allowed us to change its design to better fit tower and the broader tower ecosystem (i.e. axum). For instance, we no longer need writable and readable sessions, and have simplified the interface as a result.\r\n\r\nI'd be curious if there's interest in migrating and am happy to help if so.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/valorem-labs-inc/quay/issues/92/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/valorem-labs-inc/quay/issues/92/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
