PatchGuard is double edged sword - from one side it is sort of security feature and barrier that effectively stops most of script-kiddies with their \"hooking, dkom, dkoh whatever\" trash from making yet another WindowsXP hell everywhere. From the other side it is guardian for DRM related trash and complicated some other things. Unfortunately it is here and won't be likely removed anytime soon.\r\n\r\nFor the current state of PatchGuard you can read from this wonderful paper\r\nhttps://blog.tetrane.com/downloads/Tetrane_PatchGuard_Analysis_RS4_v1.00.pdf\r\n\r\nFrom it you can learn PatchGuard now implemented not only as a rootkit component but also as independent integrity checks smashed within multiple various kernel routines, reference to page 28. So in general this mean full PatchGuard disable need more work and more investigations to find all of the hidden checks.\r\n\r\nSo far consider this repository as for historical purposes only if it comes to Windows 10 PatchGuard.\r\n\r\nYou are still welcome to contribute, fork and do whatever you want.
