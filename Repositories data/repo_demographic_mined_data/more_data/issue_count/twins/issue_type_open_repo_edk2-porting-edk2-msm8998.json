The Pixel 4a uses the Snapdragon 730 SOC, which is different from the Snapdragon 835 SOC used in the supported devices listed. I would like to know if it's feasible to build and use this firmware on the Pixel 4a or if there are specific modifications needed to support this device.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n\r\nI expect to receive guidance on whether it is possible to build the UEFI firmware for the Pixel 4a and, if so, what changes or additions would be necessary.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n\r\nCurrently, I have no information on whether the UEFI firmware can be successfully built and run on the Pixel 4a or what steps would be required for this process.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edk2-porting/edk2-msm8998/issues/44/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edk2-porting/edk2-msm8998/issues/44/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
