The weird thing about this is that my card officially supports ray tracing since its an Nvidia RTX 3060. I have the mesa-opencl-icd package installed and am running kernel 5.13.0. This should be working according to the README but i suspect that either a dependency is missing or there is an issue with the GPU detection. Any help on this issue would be useful.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/issues/22/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/issues/22/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
