I'm struggling to get it to work and I'm wondering if there's a problem I can help diagnose, or whether I'm doing something wrong.\n\nI've tried running this on our Apple TV 3.2 from my M2 MacBook Air running OS X 14.6.1.\n\nI discovered in some other issue that it's important to update/restore the TV  using Finder, so I did that first.\n\nI ran the Jailbreak, and it popped up the message saying it was time to plug it into HDMI and would automatically reboot. I unplugged the USB cable, plugged the HDMI cable in, but when it booted up I saw this.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f74c02c6-a747-4785-8609-4c2c869d3b59)\n\nThis felt to me like it hadn't worked, but I left it for a while, perhaps half an hour, hoping something was happening in the background. Eventually the HDMI just goes blank. The light on the Apple TV is pulsing.\n\nI gave up in the end and hit Menu+Play which seemed to reboot it. I saw an Apple logo and it booted up as normal.\n\nI'm assuming that, once it works, you don't see the Apple Logo or regular menu, but it boots straight into Kodi?\n\nAny clues as to what I might be doing wrong, or how I could debug/diagnose it?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/169/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NSSpiral/Blackb0x/issues/169/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
