(it worked 1 month ago with the compiled version I had since extra_recipe is out)\r\nSadly, I have no mac and my friends either have no macs also or don't want to share their macs for installing xcode, debugging etc. I can use the mac from my work - I'm very limited here. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to get a compiled ipa in xCode (note: I do not own a paid developer subscription). Google doesn't help. When I try to debug extra_recipe on my ipad, I'm getting \"Failed to allocate fixed mapping: (os/kern) no space available\" in jailbreak.c line 213. \r\n\r\nI am a programmer, but this level is too high for me. Any help would be awesome.
