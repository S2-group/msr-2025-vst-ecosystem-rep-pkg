I've been trying to get his v1 firmware flashed for over a week. Any insight into how to do this? Or would your firmware be able to turn the GC Controller into a switch controller? It seems like his code is extremely outdated compared to the current version of espressif so it's been he'll especially since I'm a beginner at coding and have only ever used micro python and circut python on raspberry pi products. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Idk if Nathan died or moved on but he's not active on anything I can find as of 2 years ago.
