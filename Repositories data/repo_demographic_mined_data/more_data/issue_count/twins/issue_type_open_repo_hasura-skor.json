We have added all of Skor's existing features and even more to make it production ready:\r\n\r\n 1) Reliable: We capture every relevant action on the database as an event, even when Hasura is down! The events are delivered to your webhook as soon as possible with an atleast-once guarantee.\r\n\r\n2) Scalable: What more, it even scales horizontally. If you are processing millions of events, just add more instances of GraphQL engine.\r\n\r\n3) Use with Serverless: If you are using Skor, then avoid the pain of managing your webhook by moving to Serverless infrastructure.
