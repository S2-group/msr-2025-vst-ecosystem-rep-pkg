This means I have to perform a few more steps to search for Wikis, then iterate through each one to get the remote URLs for further cloning and analysis.  Someone else may also like to specify **includeAllUrls** and **includeLinks** as well, so I'm wondering if you could leave the existing getRepositories() method alone and add a convenience method that accepts those three switches?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance - this is a genuinely useful library! - Scott", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hkarthik7/azure-devops-java-sdk/issues/68/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hkarthik7/azure-devops-java-sdk/issues/68/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
