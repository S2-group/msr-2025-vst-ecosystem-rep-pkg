I've been trying to reach you on other sites for quite awhile. Many thanks for the Linux audio scripting you do! However, I run Pop!_OS (a fork of Ubuntu) and I've run into a problem running your Ubuntu script. It errors out during Pipewire installation. I _suspect_ (but have not confirmed) that this is because the latest Pop versions already come with Pipewire and Wireplumber.\r\n\r\nI'm running Pop!_OS v22.04. Would you please write a modified script for Pop? \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude42 I would be glad to help you test it. It would be very beneficial for me and many others as Pop is getting quite **pop**ular! \ud83d\ude09\r\n\r\nUltimately I'd like to be running Bitwig and Reaper on Linux, and use the VST3 (Windows) Satellite Plugins v2.0 for remote collaboration.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/brendaningram/linux-audio-setup-scripts/issues/4/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/brendaningram/linux-audio-setup-scripts/issues/4/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null, "score": 1.0}]}
