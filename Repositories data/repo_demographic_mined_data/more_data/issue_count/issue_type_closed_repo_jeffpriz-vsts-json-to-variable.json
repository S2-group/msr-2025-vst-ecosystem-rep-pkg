Firstly, thanks for the useful task!\r\n\r\nWe've noticed the following warnings appearing during builds:\r\n\r\n`[warning]This task uses Node 6 execution handler, which will be removed March 31st 2022. If you are the developer of the task - please consider the migration guideline to Node 10 handler - https://aka.ms/migrateTaskNode10 (check this page also if you would like to disable Node 6 deprecation warnings). If you are the user - feel free to reach out to the owners of this task to proceed on migration.`\r\n\r\nAre you likely to update to the Node 10 handler? It would be good to know in advance if you decide not to so that we can start looking for alternatives, but hopefully you will be updating because this is such a useful build task!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jeffpriz/vsts-json-to-variable/issues/39/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jeffpriz/vsts-json-to-variable/issues/39/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed", "score": 1.0}]}
