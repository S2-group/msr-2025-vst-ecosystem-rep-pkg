Please describe!**

Some plugins, especially Arturia's plugins have a lovely patch browsing system which let you midi learn the next/previous preset buttons. This makes playing through banks of presets a joy. Easy and fun. For people with less than perfect eye-sight, also, a keyboard and or a midi shortcut for patch navigation would be a usability improvement.

**Describe the solution you'd like:**

A.  Cursor Up/Down keys mapped to next/previous preset.
B.  Ability to right click on next and previous preset and click midi learn.


**Describe alternatives you've considered:**

There could be alternative ways to do this via some other way of setting up midi mappings, but midi learn would be the most clear and direct method.

**Additional context:**

This is not just a feature request it's a usability improvement for people with limited vision, and for people who are using Surge XT as a live instrument.

Surge does not appear to be updating its LV2 controller input ports
 upon program changes done from the GUI.

**Surge XT Version**
Surge XT 1.2.3.bb8dd2b

* Version: 1.2.3
* Plugin Type: LV2
* Bitness: 64-bit

**Reproduction Steps:**
In QTractor or MusE, open Surge's native GUI and the 
 corresponding QTractor or MusE generic GUI.
Now change program in Surge by selecting a program or clicking
 program up/down or category up/down.
Observe that all the native GUI controls correctly change to new positions
 but the generic GUI controls do not change at all.

**Expected Behavior:**
Generic GUI controls should follow what the native GUI shows
 after a program change initiated inside the native GUI.

**Screenshots:**

**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**
 - OS: OpenSuse Tumbleweed
 - Host: Either QTractor or MusE
 - Version: QTractor 0.9.33 or MusE 4.1 release or latest master

**Additional Information:**
In LV2 lv2extprg.h, there is this statement (nearly identical to the old DSSI statement):
```
     * A plugin is permitted to re-write the values of its input
     * control ports when select_program is called. The host should
     * re-read the input control port values and update its own
     * records appropriately. (This is the only circumstance in which
     * a LV2 plugin is allowed to modify its own control-input ports.)
```
Trouble is, Surge does not seem to have any midi programs with which I can test
 that statement by selecting a program from within our host.
But also, this bug report is such that changing programs from within Surge GUI
 also does not appear to be updating its input control ports.
When we instantiate a UI descriptor, we pass a callback for the LV2UI_Write_Function argument.
Most LV2 synths seem to call this when a program changes via the GUI.
That lets us re-read the input ports and update our records.
But Surge does not appear to calling this upon program changes.

Meanwhile, Surge seems to be one of the only plugins to call the 'program_changed' callback
 in the _LV2_Programs_Host structure. 
This is good. 
But... Upon the 'program_changed' callback, when I examine all the input control ports
 so that I may update our records, none of the input ports have changed at all to reflect what 
 is now on screen in the native GUI.

Thus, it appears **impossible** for us to determine what is the new state of the on screen GUI controls
 after a program change from within the GUI, so that we may update our records.

This behaviour is seen in both MusE and QTractor.
Other synths tested do update the generic GUI controls after a program change from within the GUI.

Surge Effects standalone briefly opens and then crashes when using Jabra Elite 75t bluetooth headphones. I'm not sure if this would happen with other bluetooth headphones. I don't have any on hand to test.

**Surge XT Version**
Surge XT Effects 1.2.3.bb8dd2b
2023-05-05

* Bitness: 64-bit arm

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Have the Jabra earbuds activated, connected, and set as the computer's audio output.
2. Play some audio. I was listening to something on Apple Music.
3. Click on Surge XT Effects to open it.
4. It will open for a little bit, and you will hear the sound change as the system audio gets rerouted(?). Then it will close, and probably cause an Apple crash report to be generated.

I think this has something to do with either this model of bluetooth earbuds or bluetooth audio in general, as the app works fine when system audio is set to laptop speakers. Switching to the jabras after the app has successfully opened does not cause the crash.

**Expected Behavior:**
Surge XT Effects opens and can be used.

**Screenshots:**
If applicable, add screenshots/GIF/videos to help explain your problem.

**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**
 - OS: 13.4.1 (c) (22F770820d)
 - Host: Standalone

**Additional Information:**

Snippet from crash report.

I might even go as so far as to say we are done with #576 with this commit but I'm sure there will be comments and changes still. So here's how it works

1. We add a new directory %USER%/Patches/MIDI Programs
2. We add a new data structure `patchIdToMidiBankAndProgram[128][128]` which for a bank and program is used for a patch id
3. We populate it as follows

   a. If `MIDI Programs` has top level patches those become bank 0 b. If `MIDI Programs` has directories, those fill in order. So a just-directories MIDI programs has bank 0 as the first directory and a mix and match has bank 0 as the raw top level and bank 1 as the first directory c. If there's still banks to be filled we fill them one at a time from factor. So if you have 6 directories in MIDI Programs, bank 7 will become 'Basses' (the first factory)

By 'fill' we mean traverse the category in alphabetical order and set the patches as programs, up to 128

Banks with < 128 patches don't respond to PCH for the empty slots
Categories with > 128 patches only map the first 128",https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7171/timeline,,,1.0,baconpaul,13387561.0,MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul,https://github.com/baconpaul,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events,User,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7171/reactions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/pulls/7171,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7171,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7171.diff,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/7171.patch,2023-08-11T20:01:51Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Surge VST3 becomes silent when first using it in 6 channel mode, and then changing it back to stereo:

```
/* Enable all output busses */
_component->activateBus (Vst::kAudio, Vst::kOutput, 0, true);
_component->activateBus (Vst::kAudio, Vst::kOutput, 1, true);
_component->activateBus (Vst::kAudio, Vst::kOutput, 2, true);

/* Now only enable stereo-out */
_component->activateBus (Vst::kAudio, Vst::kOutput, 0, true);
_component->activateBus (Vst::kAudio, Vst::kOutput, 1, false); // XXX
_component->activateBus (Vst::kAudio, Vst::kOutput, 2, false);
```

At `XXX` above

https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/blob/aa66b292bdb21c229820ff93fd936fda0cf976ae/src/surge-xt/SurgeSynthProcessor.cpp#L212

`c1 == 0`  (first output bus was just disabled) but `c2 ==2` (second bus is still active): `isBusesLayoutSupported` returns false;

JUCE's  `AudioProcessor::getNextBestLayout` ends up with an empty layout, and `AudioProcessor::applyBusLayouts` disables all outputs incl. the default stereo output. `newNumberOfOuts == 0`.

Even if the final configuration step succeeds, the first bus remains disabled, and then `SurgeSynthProcessor::processBlock` just returns without producing sound.

This does not happen with JUCE's default implementation of `AudioPluginAudioProcessor::isBusesLayoutSupported` in which the connection order is not significant.

Proposed solution, allow any stereo bus configuration: 

```diff
diff --git a/src/surge-xt/SurgeSynthProcessor.cpp b/src/surge-xt/SurgeSynthProcessor.cpp
index 97634083..2d47c4c4 100644

     return outputValid && inputValid && sceneOut;
 }
```

It seems overly restrictive, to only allow both scenes or none of them. That being said, JUCE's logic in ` Bus::isLayoutSupported` -> `AudioProcessor::getNextBestLayout` is also questionable.


**Surge XT Version**
 release_xt_1.1.2-101-gaa66b292

* Version:
* Plugin Type:  VST3


**Reproduction Steps:**
Load the Plugin in Ardour 7.3.0

With a debug version of Ardour you can use `Ardour7 -DVST3Config` to print calls to `activateBus` as they' are made. Then play with plugin pin connections.  Initially Ardour enables all outputs and then the plugin is reconfigured  as stereo:

Due to differences on the version shipped with Rack vs the one shipped with surge, there can be symbol conflicts.

A possible solution is to be able to use a custom simde version, alike done with juce.
That should be the approach for surge-rack too IMO, since the library is already provided by the Rack SDK modules built against VCV Rack should use it instead of their own custom version.

Alternatively the built-in simde could be contained in a custom namespace, but not sure how much work that is..

Please describe!**

My only problem with Surge is being able to only see a single oscillator onscreen at once. Surge is a fabulous synth but I find myself often avoiding using it because of slow access to oscillators. It's not that switching between oscillators is so slow, but I feel like I'm always worried about what's on the other oscillator page. I find it's a kinda ""stressful"" UI because of the oscillator switching. Surge would be so much cooler if you could relax and just look at one page. I think it's a design priority problem that we have access to 8 macro slots yet access to the oscillators is more limited.

**Describe the solution you'd like:**

It would be really great if there could be a new ""wide"" UI mode that presents all three oscillators onscreen simultaneously. This could help to make Surge more hands-on friendly. I realize there would be more onscreen but looking at three oscillators instead of 1 is not that difficult, and perhaps a new skin could color code background areas of the different synthesis sections.",https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6841/timeline,,completed,1.0,Yzrsah,43947786.0,MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQ3Nzg2,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43947786?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah,https://github.com/Yzrsah,https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/followers,https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/repos,https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/Yzrsah/received_events,User,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6841/reactions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7

> On another subject, sorry if this has come up before but, when dealing with tree views such as the patch browser tree view and the configuration tree, is there any way to make the cursor retain its position after an option has been selected? In this way, once a patch has been selected, you could carry on your keyboard browsing from that point and when, for example, making changes to the workflow menu to optimise accessibility, you would have to keep renavigating the tree again.

The ""Freeze"" parameter in the Nimbus effect cannot be modulated by a scene envelope. Confusingly, ED was able to actually make it work and even send me a patch where it is modulated, which I could load! However, myself and at least one other person confirmed that we weren't able to do it on our systems!

**Surge XT Version**
Latest nightly

* Version: Latest nightly
* Plugin Type: standalone
* Bitness: 64-bit

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Load template ""Init Saw""
2. Add Nimbus effect to first FX on chain A.
3. Click on ""S-LFO 1"". Change it to the template ""Basic ADSR"".
4. Set D to 1 second, S to 100%, every other slider to 0.
5. Try to drag and drop it onto the ""Freeze"" slider. Does not work. (It can successfully be dropped on any other parameter.)

**Expected Behavior:**
Freeze parameter is modulatable.

Please describe!**

It would be nice to have a quick way to review settings for patches without the need to tab and arrow through everything for keyboard users.

**Describe the solution you'd like:**

A button or menu choice to export the control names and settings for the current patch to an HTML file that reflects the interface groups of controls, but with headings and bulleted lists. For example, Seen 1 would be a heading 2, Osc 1 would be a heading 3, and so on. Perhaps it would even be possible for the feature to open the browser to this file.

**Describe alternatives you've considered:**

I considered either talking and recording the settings I have found or typing them into a file.

**Additional context:**

I know we could also simply save patches and give them to each other, but this feature would speed up looking through settings for people who only use keyboard who are blind, and even prevent accidental changing of parameters, although leaving the warning on about not over-writing the patch is also a good thing to keep active.",https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6811/timeline,,completed,1.0,jhomme,6507685.0,MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDc2ODU=,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6507685?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/jhomme,https://github.com/jhomme,https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/followers,https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/repos,https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/jhomme/received_events,User,False,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/31,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/31,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/31/labels,8570089.0,MI_kwDOCOvoes4AgsTp,31.0,Surge XT 1.2,"Guess we are doing a 1.2!

Playing midi note zero with the `Keys/DX EP.fxp` and `Basses/Bass 1.fxp` patches gives different pitches when using retuning (tuning files used below).

**Surge XT Version**
I used surgepy built from commit [21bfcdb](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/commit/21bfcdbb0b907bee7db5dcce61c3a7b7ad0c9094) in the surge repo.

I also tested with Surge XT in Reaper:

* Version: Surge XT 1.1.makepkg.d3568a9ae
* Plugin Type: LV2
* Bitness: 64-bit

**Reproduction Steps:**
I've created a temporary repo with a surgepy script, the tuning files, and the output I get [here](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example).

To reproduce, running
```
$ git clone https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example.git
$ cd tuning_example
$ python3 tuning_example.py
``` 
loads the tuning files and plays midi note zero using the DX EP patch, producing `dx_ep.wav`. Changing `patch_name` in the script [here](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/tuning_example.py#L19) plays midi note 0 with the Bass 1 patch, producing `bass_1.wav`. Listening to the two wav files, `bass_1.wav` has a pitch a major third below `dx_ep.wav`. This corresponds to the `5/4` in the scl file [here](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/example.scl#L9); changing the 5/4 moves the pitch Bass 1 plays (the DX EP pitch remains the same).

I also saw this behaviour in Reaper by:
- Creating a new project and track
- Adding Surge XT to the track FX
- Setting the patch to DX EP
- Loading the [scl](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/example.scl) and [kbm](https://github.com/narenratan/tuning_example/blob/main/example.kbm) files 
- Adding the Midi Sequencer Baby before Surge XT
- Setting the sequencer to loop midi note 0 and playing the track
- Switching between the DX EP and Bass 1 patches

This leads to the pitch moving by a major third when I switch between the patches

**Expected Behavior:**
I would expect that the pitches produced when using the DX EP and Bass 1 patches would be the same. In particular the DX EP pitch is the one I would expect.


**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**
 - OS: Linux (Arch Linux)
 - Host: Python and Reaper
 - Version: Python 3.10, Reaper v6.69

**Additional Information:**
This is a minimal example of something I ran into when using retuning with a just intonation sequencer I am working on. Using different patches for different parts in a song was changing the pitch of some parts. I made the scl and kbm files above with Scale Workshop to be safe.

Thank you for Surge! I've been using Surge in a command line just intonation sequencer I'm writing in Python, so Surge's tuning support and Python API have been super useful :)

It would be handy for me to be able to include surgepy as a dependency for my project, so I had a look at packaging it as a Python package. It turns out there is a tool [scikit-build](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) specifically for packaging Python extensions built with CMake. In case it would be of interest, this PR is to make surgepy installable as a Python package using scikit-build. It's based on the scikit-build pybind example project [here](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-sample-projects/tree/master/projects/hello-pybind11).

With this branch you can run
```
python3 -m pip install <REPO_DIR>
```
on the surge repo to build and install surgepy as a Python package. I've used this to install surgepy in a Python virtual environment to use for development.

Also I've built a Python binary wheel for surgepy so I can install it without building it every time. I tested installing the wheel in a Ubuntu VM and it works. Using wheels it would be possible to create a surgepy package on PyPI so people could `pip install surgepy` and it would just work.

Thank you again for Surge!",https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6790/timeline,,,1.0,narenratan,57327970.0,MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzI3OTcw,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57327970?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/narenratan,https://github.com/narenratan,https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/followers,https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/repos,https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/narenratan/received_events,User,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6790/reactions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/pulls/6790,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/6790,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/6790.diff,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/pull/6790.patch,2023-01-10T20:16:43Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

All the code from https://github.com/ODDSound/MTS-ESP references a system library that must be loaded at runtime.
There is no public code for libMTS.so

I even suspect this is a GPL violation, the MTS client code is directly calling a proprietary library and Surge is using MTS client code. Would need a deeper investigation..

For now I would appreciate a way to disable this feature, I was surprised to find there is a reliance on an external library from a plugin (even if optional)
There is likely more stuff needed, but my knowledge of cmake is very lacking so I just did the code.

When using the CLAP plugin, Surge XT's virtual keyboard does not highlight key presses.

Everything seems to work fine otherwise.

**Surge XT Version**

1.1.2 (1.1.makepkg.d3568a9ae on ArchLinux)

* Version: 1.1.2
* Plugin Type: CLAP
* Bitness: 64bit

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add SurgeXT CLAP plugin to a track on Reaper or Bitwig under (Arch)Linux
2. Enable Virtual Keyboard
3. Play MIDI controller and watch virtual keyboard not be highlighted

**Expected Behavior:**

The keys on the virtual keyboard should be highlighted, same as in the VST3 plugin.

```

We use `fxdata->p[].get_extended` which is fine but use it in `fxdata->p[].val.f` which is the value, not the modulated value.

Replace that with 

```
 storage->note_to_pitch(*f[rm_carrier_freq] +
                                       fxdata->p[rm_unison_detune].get_extended(

Thanks for the awesome work on Surge XT!!!

I would like to request (I'm not experienced enough) if somebody can add in the next update a trance supersaw preset.
The only thing I know is that it uses 2 or 3 oscillators (saw of course) but I don't know how to construct it together.
Would be nice to have an example preset in included in Surge.

Hi all.  I have a suggestion to aid usability for keyboard users - the typing keyboard that is.  If I set up a parameter with modulation, could the LFO controls region switch to showing that modulator?  So if I add a modulator to my osc 1 pitch using voice 1, if I then alt full stop to the LFO controls region, it should be on the voice 1 controls.  If I then added a filter, and modulation of the cut off frequency with voice 2, and I go to the LFO controls, it would have shifted to the voice 2 controls.  So whenever I set up a new modulation the focus of the LFO controls region shifts to show that modulator.  This would save having to go to the modulator region to select the LFO.

baconpaul — Today at 5:15 PM

oh so like ""add modulation from lfo1"" in the menu selects lfo1?
that's a bit of a pain for the signted ui since that menu is meant to allow you to add modulators from ""away"" sources while looking at ""current"" sources. but i see why you want it.

Yes. Exactly.

Example 1: The Surge XT manual precises: ""Note: Some actions in Surge XT are done by doing Alt + Drag or scroll wheel. On certain Linux distributions, those shortcuts and gestures may cause conflicts between Surge and the desktop environment. We decided we couldn't give up alt-drag for all platforms because one window manager in one distribution used it by default. Therefore, it's often possible to disable that global gesture in desktop environments, and would be the easiest way to solve that possible issue.""

In fact, when we use a desktop environment and other applications with their own requirements, wo don't always want to change our shortcuts for just one application, even if it is Surge XT that we love a lot!

On Linux, the key ""Alt"" in Surge could be changed by the ""Windows"" key for example but it should always be a user choice.

Example 2: On my desktop environment, the ""Shift + F10"" does not work and this combination can't be changed in the shortcuts configuration panel while it is an important shortcut.

Example 3: How can we configure the keys of the virtual keyboard? By trials and errors, I discovered that ""}"" and ""c"" are my keys to change the octave, that ""a"" give a C note, and so on. Perhaps i could be configured somewhere but I didn't found where.

Example 4: Some people use DVORAK or other keymap that fits their needs. All the shortcuts often needs to be configured to have a pleasant experience.

Long live to Surge XT!

Surge XT publishes parameters for per-channel modulation in the Clap plugin version. However those don't actually currently work per channel.

I can see a couple of ways to handle this :

1) Make Surge not publish parameters as supporting the per-channel modulation. Not preferable but at least hosts could avoid in that case showing any per-channel modulation options for the user.
2) If possible, make the parameters actually work so that the Clap note event channel is taken into account.

The ADSR of the EG seems to me a poor design of Surge's filters compared to other very intuitive settings.
Other synths use a graphical view in which you can drag with the mouse the ADSR points.
For example see Exakt Lite 

https://www.sonicbits.com/exakt-lite.html

**Describe the solution you'd like:**
It would be great if we could click the current EG graph and a bigger windows pops up with a Exakt Lite's similar bigger graph with editable (with the mouse) ADSR points so users can choose not to use the 4 sliders (which I don't think are user friendly controls here). Also immediate feedback in the graph is seen (which is now according to my understanding much harder to see in this small graph).
Maybe the ADSR sliders can be replaced completely in the future by this method?

See the LMMS project as an example.

Please describe!**
I think everybody agrees Surge XT is becoming a synth swiss army knife of features which is good, but it's also a bit bad for beginners.
Why? Because it gets overwhelming when you want to learn then basic synth concepts. There are so many options it's hard for beginners to see the 'big picture' of how a synth works at basic level. I'm a beginner myself and I'm learning Surge myself by 'ignoring' the most advanced features (just to not have too much concepts to understand all at once) and then slowly learning those too, when I know the basics.


**Describe the solution you'd like:**
I would like to' request a feature that can set Surge into standard or advanced mode.

Standard mode allows changing the most basic features so Surge can be used as a learning tool for people wanting to learn digital synths or for people not needing the more advanced features. But Standard mode should make certain advanced options unavailable (disable the menu item or button so it requires not much code changes and the user just can't click it) so beginners are not 'lost' in the ever growing amount of features. 
Maybe limiting the number of parallel things too (or number of LFOs, ...)

Advanced mode should be Surge XT as it is now: all options and features enabled.

I'm a woman speaking Dutch as native language.
I'm interested in translating the surge XT manual to Dutch.

However I have no knowledge of html, tools, compiling documentation, websites, ... 
So I only can use a text editor or a program like LibreOffice

Is there a way I can translate the text and provide the team with a LibreOffice document containing the translated text, so you can convert it to the right format to put online (like the English version)?
I will put in all pictures too and respect all paragraphs of the text, so you can exactly see where the text is located and it can be copy-pasted very easy for the person who will put it in the desired format.

Ps: please note I'm autistic and need VERY clear instructions on how to do this correctly (I mean the format to use for the translation. The translation itself is no problem as I have good English knowledge).
As a consequence of my autism, I don't like to go into chatboxes like Discord (real-time chat) so going to surge's Discord server is not an option for me.
So I prefer contacting on github here or if anybody wants to help me personally by email (to get me up-and-running) that's OK too.

Ps 2: I have a very strong dedication when I'm doing something. This means I want to keep updating my translation for updates.
Unfortunately I never worked with github and don't know how to do a PR, ... I'm actually a bit scared of doing something wrong.
If it's possible, I would like to give my translation here as an attachment so a contributor can submit it in the correct way.
Maybe if it's easy to do this on github (I never used github), I can try to do it myself.

So that's why I ask if somebody can 'guide' me here so I can contribute to this wonderfull project by translating the manual to Dutch.

Thank you
Lien

Since discovering Swami Project ( http://www.swamiproject.org/ )  on my linux system, having lots of fun creating my own soundfonts & playing with existing soundfonts.
Although maybe dated, the open soundfont format is  very powerfull, almost endless possibilities for making professional sounds & presets from short wav files into a single sf2 file ! 
Wav files can be looped, played once, layered ect, would be super to be able to combine this with surge XT's synth features.

So what's to be done still?

- [x] Include it in installer
    - [x] zip file all platforms
    - [x] macos embedded in standalone
    - [x] deb
    - [x] rpm
    - [x] win64 maybe? maybe not?
- [x] sample rate, buffer size as arguments
- [x] use default audio device if nothing specified 
- [x] consistency check on command line arguments
- [x] bind all midi option
- [x] stopping condition 
- [x] output channel (right now on device we bind to output 0,1 only - that's the nasty bitset
- [x] inputs? Do we want to bother
- [x] add to manual

Dropping the Mojo FX onto itself will cause Reaper to crash when on a specific preset.

**Surge XT Version**
This information is found on the About screen, which you get to from the bottom right menu.

* Version: 1.2.0.cb11acd
* Plugin Type: VST3
* Bitness: 64-bit

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. 1st select the 'Slowboat > Rhythms > Bellish Shape Shimmer' preset from the 3rd party section.
2. Look for the Airwindows Mojo FX on the Global FX 2 slot at the end.
3. Left-click, drag and move the FX box slightly, and then release so it drops onto the same spot (onto itself).
4. Reaper will then crash.

**Expected Behavior:**
There should be no change to the FX or slot when dropping onto itself, and there usually isn't.

**Screenshots:**
N/A.

**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**
 - OS: Windows 10 Home
 - Host: Reaper
 - Version: 6.80

**Additional Information:**
This doesn't happen on the initial patch.

**Surge XT Version**
Version: Surge XT 1.3.nightly.605b717
Build: 2023-06-05 @ 22:22:33 on 'WIN-9J4PM7PJGLL/pipeline' with 'MSVC-19.29.30148.0' using JUCE 7.0.5
System: Windows 64-bit VST3 on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz
Host: Cakewalk by Bandlab @ 44.1 kHz / Process block size: 32 samples


**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. While editing Scene B [might not be relevant], create a delay in FX slot G2.
2. Arm a macro.
3. Modulate the Mix [or any] parameter of created DLY.

When you click on the slider to modulate, the hover text shows memory junk, where I expect to see the possible range of the applied modulation.

**Expected Behavior:**
I expect to see the possible range of the applied modulation.

2. Set OSC1 to any type
3. Try and adjust an OSC parameter with the mouse
4. Some of the parameters will suddenly snap to a different value (from the default) as soon as the left mouse button is pressed

Particularly, this always happens with FM2 and FM3 Feedback, causing me great distress as it goes from 0% to -396% immediately, but I also found it occurs with most parameters in all oscillators, for example, all parameters of the String oscillator snap to some other value from what they were initially, except for Pitch. The values they snap to don't appear to be entirely consistent (other than FM2/3's remarkably consistent -396% Feedback) (nvm this time it snapped to -270% idk)

By setting the oscillator type to reset the sliders, this bug seems to reset and can be retriggered again, although some, like FM2/3's Feedback, would be seemingly cured and won't snap again until I initialize a new instance of Surge XT.

here is a Feature Request: Visualize the modulation of parameters as value changes of the sliders in modulation mode (= middle mouse click). 
Objective: This would give immediate visual feedback how the Modulation Source is changing the Destination, and which Destinations are changed by the Source..

_Example:
So, e.g. if the Cutoff slider is set to ~C5, and the Cutoff slider has a as modulation source LFO1, which is set to sine, bipolar and 1 Hz rate and 100% left/right (13 Hz/25000Hz). The grey/green line should move accordingly from full left/ full right to the center, back and forth._

-------------
Even more oscillator wave shape shaping control would be great.

More flexible ""shaping"" options for the oscillator shape will give you countless custom waveshapes (with their own tuneable spectra). A great addition to (custom) wavetables, that have their own pro's and con's (e.g. finding/selecting/building them).

Surge already has several (many!) great oscillator shaping functions. Surge also already has the slider controls to control the shaping amount. And these slider are also a modulation targets. All great! But it could be even better!

Even some extra ""simple"" squeeze/stretch transformations in the Horizontal (Time) and Vertical (Amplitude) domain are great.

Maybe add extra shape distortion curves/functions as a modulator for the oscillator shape in time and/or amplitude domain. Or even allow custom shapes (via editor or import). Or even dynamically shapeable shaping shapes....

Anyway...

Of course there are infinite possibilities in Wave shaping shapes and functions. Even when just applying this to the amplitude domain. Sort of companding/distortion of the amplitude (vertical) domain of the wave shape. A common wave shaping/distortion function). Already implemented in Surge in some forms / signal path stages.

But of course this can also be applied to the time (horizontal) domain. Surge already offers this in some form too. With the right shape/function you can achive something ""simple"" as ""PWM"" of say an symmetric SAW into a asymetric SAW. By companding/distoring over the time domain. To visualize: where the zero crossing is shift left, compressing anything left of the zero crossing, expanding anything to the right.

Since the time domain is revlevant for both frequency and phase, you could als modulate phase to distort/shape a wave. Some words on that below in the ""special"" bit on FM/PM/PD.

In general, you can apply any wave shaping curve at any amount to the time and/or amplitude domain of the oscillator wave shape. Added control over the Oscillator Shape Wave Shaping curve (in the Oscillator section) would be great to. Some edit functions would be tops. But some clever presets would be great too. Or some ""wavetable"" like option, where you can morph between fixed shapes?

Filter Analysis Window: Visualization does not move when Cutoff/Resonance is changed via CC (MIDI learn with + external Midi controller)

**Surge XT Version**
* Version: 1.1.1
* Plugin Type: VST3
* Bitness: 64-bit

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Surge XT as VST3 in Cakewalk by Bandlab
2. Assign Cutoff  to MIDI Controller (e.g. CC 118) via MIDI learn
3. Open Filter Analysis Window
4. Try to change Cutoff via MDII controller, result: The cutoff slider moves, but not the visualisation in the Filter Analysis Window 
(ps. The frequency visualisation in the Filter Analysis Window moves when i move the cuoff slider with the mouse)

**Expected Behavior:**
 The frequency visualisation in the Filter Analysis Window should also move when cutoff is changed via external CC/MIDI controller. 

**Screenshots:**
If applicable, add screenshots/GIF/videos to help explain your problem.

**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Host: Cakewalk by Bandlab
 - Version: 9/2022

**Additional Information:**
 Its a Notebook with Intel Graphic Card.


Thank you for this great synth and for having a look at this issue.

They are always behind the Surge UI window, whether the latter is pinned or not. 

EDIT: So there turns out to be a few related issues here. One was that the pin button was missing. This is adressed by #6634.

The other issue is that when neither window is un-pinned, the tearout windows are always-behind the main Surge UI window. Obviously window focus usually determines which window goes on top. 
This is especially annoying because it means pressing the tear-out button apparently just makes the window in question dissappear. At which point one has to move the main UI out of the way to be able to access the pin button so the tearout can go on top. Not very useful. 

In less problematic but probably related news, both windows pinned also doesn't correctly follow the last-focused-window-on-top paradigm.

After connecting to and selecting a (somewhat flakey) external usb device then quitting, removing that connection and restarting, got a hard crash (even after plugging external speakers back in.

**Surge XT Version**
1.1.0.012f6ce

* Version:
* Plugin Type: [VST2, VST3, AU]
* Bitness: [32-bit or 64-bit]

**Reproduction Steps:**
Will be hard to reproduce probably, but this was my path:

1. Selected a (somewhat flakey) external usb device in options.
2. Quit.
3. Unplugged from external audio jack (not device itself) -- perhaps this is what created bad state? 
4. On launch, hard crash. Removing that connection and restarting and changing sound options in system prferences did not fix.

**Workaround**

 I was able to fix by going into /Users/{username}/Library/Application\ Support/Surge\ XT.settings  and just deleting the VALUE audioSetup::DEVICESETUP (but most users wouldn't know to do this).

If you load a new preset with SurgeXT's preset loader, no values refreshed in host. It seemed first time like a takeover issue, but it's basically just this: no automation ""actual"" value, nor GUI knobs on host side refresh to their real value when you load a new preset. The big impact on my workflow is: I have a default preset saved for SurgeXT in Ableton Live. Surge's 8 macro knobs are made to show up as first 8 controls on live's little plugin GUI at bottom of the screen (Opening VST controls with [>] button on it and pressing Configure just to move Surge's controls to show up on Push 2's knobs. When you load a new preset in Surge, Live's GUI ""Macro1..8"" controls stay greyed at previous presets' last value and instantly jump there when you start to move given Push knobs. They are rotary encoders showing actual values on screen. This behavior completely destroys this simple use case.

**Surge XT Version**
Version: Surge XT 1.1.1.ecf7fe6
Build: 2022-08-25 @ 21:56:20 on 'WIN-KDGQ3UVP6AT/pipeline' with 'MSVC-19.29.30146.0' using JUCE 6.1.6
System: Windows 64-bit VST3 on Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4150 CPU @ 3.50GHz (Windows 10)
Host: Ableton Live 11 @ 44.1 kHz

**Reproduction Steps:**
Ableton live 11, change to midi clip view on Surge's track (Shift+Tab from device view), switch to envelopes view (two dots connected backslash form, Alt+2), move any of Surge's controls (one is enough), switch/load preset in Surge, watch that parameter changing on Surge's GUI and not changing on Live's GUI.
My use case: Switch to Device view (Shift+Tab from Clip view), open Surge's extended view on it with little triangle button pointing down/right. Press Configure button, it stays active. Move any controls on Surge GUI, watch them appearing on Live's Device view, Switch off ""Configure"" mode, and load a new preset in Surge. None of them will move. When you move any of them, their corresponding controls on Surge will jump to that wrong value first.

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '...'
3. Scroll down to '...'
4. See error

**Expected Behavior:**
Please give the host your controls new state when required! Especially on preset load.

**Screenshots:**

**Computer Information (please complete the following!):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Host: Ableton Live 11
 - Version: 11

**Additional Information:**

A clear and concise description of what the problem is. e.g. I'm always frustrated when [...]
Surge's noise is stereo only. In some situations it would be useful to switch from stereo noise to mono.
**Describe the solution you'd like:**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
The oscillator is mono and when I use the noise it is always stereo. One button to switch from stereo to mono to mono to stereo solves many situations.
**Describe alternatives you've considered:**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
It would be useful to create a noise button. Or even two buttons. One stereo and another mono.

Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

What is happening is the alt is quantizing the move but not changing the amount the move is applied. So you press up and you get jogged the same amount as if alt isn't down, but that doesn't update until you jog 'enough'. Sigh.

May be tricky to fix since that quantization jog distance isn't advertised by a param.

Please describe!**

I am frustrated when I am not sure which scene I am in or which oscillator I have selected if I am in another section of the synth.
While using Surge I would very much like the alt + s shortcuts for scenes. Alt + 1/2/3 for oscillators. used speech synthesis to tell what the status of the selection is.
Alt + s scene 1 / scene2. Alt + 1/2/3 changes the oscillator. If you are in another section like LFO I don't know after minutes if I am in one scene or another. Also for the oscillator.

**Describe the solution you'd like:**

It would be very useful while working if the screen reader would announce the selected scene or oscillator via the shortcuts.

**Describe alternatives you've considered:**

If it is easier to develop. For shortcuts, the Windows sapi 5 system speech is also good. More useful if the screen reader announced it.

and thanks for this great synth.
I'm configuring my digital workstation with some software and i want to test surge.
I'm running arch linux with pipewire and pipewire jack clients.
I wanted to test some synth so i decided to test also vst3 plugin in Carla. When i find your synth i discovered that there was an lv2 version so i compiled it with cmake.

```
git clone https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge.git
cd surge/
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -Bbuildlv2 -DSURGE_BUILD_LV2=TRUE
cmake --build buildlv2 --config Release --target surge-staged-assets
```


```

surge-fx: Relocating LV2 component
[100%] Built target surge-fx_LV2
[100%] Built target surge-fx_Packaged
[100%] Built target surge-staged-assets
```
Now what can i do? I have to copy the compiledi directory in `usr/share` or in the lv2 dir plugin which carla use to scan plugins?
Where is the lv2 plugin?
Where can i have to copy the assets?

Sorry for this question, but this is the first time i compiled some software from source with cmake

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Drag ""SD2 10-05.scl"" into Surge
2. Open the editor
3. Decrement the degree count (e.g. from 5 to 4)
4. Delete the first ratio, leaving 4 entries.
5. Play notes. They highlight correctly in the VK (based on MIDI IN) at the left of the tuning editor, but the sound is a 5-note scale (should be 4), and the wrong notes highlight in the editor.

**Expected Behavior:**
When I play the notes, I expect those entries to be highlighted.

**Additional Information:**
I'm debugging my own app that generates .scl files, and came across this bug. I can reproduce it with the .scl files provided with Surge, so provided that as a clean example and avoid external factors.",https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7048/timeline,,completed,1.0,j5v,13245475.0,MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ1NDc1,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13245475?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/j5v,https://github.com/j5v,https://api.github.com/users/j5v/followers,https://api.github.com/users/j5v/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/j5v/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/j5v/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/j5v/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/j5v/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/j5v/repos,https://api.github.com/users/j5v/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/j5v/received_events,User,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/7048/reactions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4

**Surge XT Version**

* Version:1.2.0
* Plugin Type: [VST2, VST3, AU, CLAP]
* Bitness: [64-bit]

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add Surge as VST2 plugin. 
2. Open Filter Analysis window
3. Move the point to apply cutoff filter
4. Observe that filter is working, but the host doesn't see the VST params are changed 

**Expected behavior:**
We should see the VST params of filter are also changed in the host so that we can control automation correctly, for example.

Moving a couple more alertOkCancels to the custom overlay and adding utility for the code to draw the window as discussed in the above pull request. Having the Alert and MiniEdit overlays use this - though subsequently other overlays may use this as well. My preference for the implementation of this is as a utility method, but I'm happy to add an abstraction layer instead if you prefer. We could also add more common code for buttons etc to this in the next PRs.

Questions:

1. Thoughts on standardizing between ""Ok""/""Cancel"" and ""Yes""/""No"" for these? This PR uses only the former - if we want to definitely allow both, I'll update this PR. 
2. Could you point me to how to test all the changes for this? I love this synth but I am new to it so I've never used the functionality this PR edits. 

Additionally - I'll be travelling starting tomorrow mid-day Seattle/US time and will be back Monday. So it will be difficult for me to contribute during this time.

Surge XT crashes Host (Reaper) when using dark skin. VST3 and LV2, same problem. Default skin works fine. This problem occurs only with the Plugins. The App version handles skins without problem.
So in Reaper I load a new instance of Surge on a new track. I can open and close without a problem. But as soon as I try to change to the dark skin and I close and try to reopen, the Host crashes.

Version: Surge XT 1.2.git-no-branch.git-no-commit
Build: 2023-04-12 @ 00:00:00 on 'hci-snode2-m0/local' with 'GNU-13.0.1' using JUCE 6.1.6
System: Linux 64-bit Standalone on  Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz
Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz / Process block size: 32 samples

I am trying to reverse engineer the Factory Pad ""Canadians"" into the VCV Rack version. After not getting the same 'noise' between the two synths I noticed that the standalone version does something 'weird'. The AMP EG has an attack value of ~1.5secs. But as soon as I press a note on the keyboard the volume is nearly max immediately.

Whereas in my Rack equivalent I get an attack time I expect -

Either the attack on the standalone's AMP EG is wrong OR I am misunderstanding the signal path in Surge and my VCV patch is wrong. I have read the manual's technical stuff (honestly!) but I am curious as to why the standalone attck is so fast.

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Right click on the Attack controller in the Filter EG section and learn from MIDI controller.
2. On Nektar Impact LX49+, use the first slider (called attack)


**Expected Behavior:**
A expect the slider to travel from bottom to top in correspondence to the controller.  It does not.  It only moves 1 bit, from 0 to 1.

The new FX (and presumably in the future the new OSC) have `set::basic_blocks::params::ParamMetaData` to describe the params.

So imagine if this added a few things like `canDeactivate` `canExtend` etc... and also added `withUnits` and then `std::string toString(f)` and `optional<float> fromString(const std::string &)` methods

then `Parmeter` can pick up a `std::optional<ParamMedatData>`which is set to `{}` every time you call `set_type` but is reset to the PMD in the post-init-ctrltypes param metadata copy in the FX (and in the future the OSC) and then to_string and from_string could move here.

This long lived bug (since inception) is audible in the String and (far less so) Modern oscillators which have a variety of memory and smoothing in their handling of pitch.

This will subtly change the sound of oscillators with high octaves, but will change it to be correct.

This slide is absent when using non single trigger play modes i.e. 0ms is truly instantaneous, but it of course does not quite sound the same as single trigger.

I first noticed this with linear curve and all other portamento options unchecked. I was advised by a user on the Discord to try checking constant rate and using logarithmic curve shape, since in their testing at least, this was a bit better. However, all settings will still produce a slide. Furthermore very large note jumps (a few octaves or more), have longer slides with constant rate checked than unchecked, even if the portamento time is kept at 0ms.

At first I thought this was a design limitation of the oscillators, and for string and modern types this indeed seems to be the case as they will quickly ramp/slide when performing pitch change by any means. However all other osc types can be forced into extreme, non-ramped pitch changes with lfos, or modulation from CC (if midi smoothing is disabled), so most oscs seem capable of instant portamento.",https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6984/timeline,,completed,1.0,musicalman,12602298.0,MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjAyMjk4,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12602298?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/musicalman,https://github.com/musicalman,https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/followers,https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/repos,https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/musicalman/received_events,User,False,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/32,https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestone/32,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/milestones/32/labels,9249176.0,MI_kwDOCOvoes4AjSGY,32.0,Surge XT 1.3,"We thought we'd have 1.2.1 perhaps but it didn't happen, and then PhilS came and started working on OSC, so we have it as a big feature to form a whole new release around it!",baconpaul,13387561.0,MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg3NTYx,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13387561?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul,https://github.com/baconpaul,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/followers,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/repos,https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/baconpaul/received_events,User,False,0.0,101.0,closed,2023-04-05T12:36:14Z,2023-12-08T15:44:21Z,,2023-12-08T15:44:05Z,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6984/reactions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

You type-in ""3/2"" in the pitch field of an oscillator, it won't play 3/2. 

That's because with apply after modulation checked, putting pitch to 7.00 exactly is remapped to 7 keys up, and typing in 3/2 doesn't land you on 7 steps it lands you on ≈7.02. 

So you probably expected to land on 3/2 since that's what you typed in, and that interval is in your scale. But instead you landed a bit sharp of the 7th degree in your scale. How sharp depends on what the 8th degree is, since this mode interpolates the pitches between the integer degrees.

There are two options for solving this. Either we just document it as it is, basically saying ""in this mode, always type in pitch offsets as 100 cent intervals. 

...or make it so whenever the user types in a ratio that's present in the scale, make sure the param ends in the place that actually makes that sound. 

The latter would be more intuitive in some cases. But of course, it'd still only be when playing the root of the scale that you'd actually be guaranteed to hear the interval you typed in.

Oneshot Factory WTs are no longer oneshots after moving to assuming 1024 frames when loading a WAV file without loop metadata.

**Surge XT Version**
Version: Surge XT 1.2.main.d57eed25
Build: 2023-04-17 @ 23:02:03 on 'rainbow/local' with 'Clang-15.0.7' using JUCE 6.1.6
System: Linux 64-bit VST3 on  AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Eight-Core Processor
Host: Ardour @ 96.0 kHz / Process block size: 8 samples

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select a WT oscillator
2. Load Factory Wavetables -> Oneshot -> [any of them]
3. Notice it's not a oneshot anymore, but a WT with 1024 frames.

**Expected Behavior:**
Oneshots are still oneshots.

**Additional Information:**
A proper fix for importing WAVs without loop information is issue #3436 but until then we should patch the factory files to have the correct metadata.

Every time I close then re-open an instance of Surge XT, the size of the window increases.

**Surge XT Version**
Version: Surge XT 1.2.0.cb11acd
Build: 2023-04-10 @ 13:12:17 on 'fv-az238-859/pipeline' with 'MSVC-19.29.30148.0' using JUCE 6.1.6
System: Windows 64-bit VST3 on AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor            
Host: Steinberg Cubase @ 48.0 kHz / Process block size: 32 samples

Above was copy-pastaed from Surge XT's version info.

Additionally: I'm running Cubase 12 on Windows 10.

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. In Cubase, select an instrument track containing an instance of Surge XT
2. In the inspector on the left-hand side, click 'edit instrument' to re-open the instance of Surge XT
3. Exit the instance, and re-open it, it should be zoomed in larger than last time.
4. Repeat until it covers an area larger than your desktop resolution.

**Expected Behavior:**
I expected the window to be the same size as last time, not bigger.

I'm holding off on the screenshots because... it's the same thing. But bigger. I'm also not sure about the possibility it's just my DAW, I feel like I would've been able to find a previously reported closed issue at least mentioning it. None of my other VST3 plugins exhibit this sort of behavior.",https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6942/timeline,,completed,1.0,jwong00,8384248.0,MDQ6VXNlcjgzODQyNDg=,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8384248?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/jwong00,https://github.com/jwong00,https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/followers,https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/repos,https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/jwong00/received_events,User,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://api.github.com/repos/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/6942/reactions,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

is there any way on WaveShaper to see the shape plot as -1/1 (input) to -1/1 (output) mapping instead of sine (as input) to -1/1 (output)?

Usually on WaveShaper thats the way it visualize the input/output (Fruity WaveShaper for example, or Trasher2 and so on).

Not sure how thats mapping is named, but any way to display it “classic way”?

In Bitwig 5 Beta 2, on Windows 10, on an Intel i7-3770 CPU, I've loaded two different projects previously saved in Bitwig 4.3.10, including tracks created with Surge XT v1.1 (one project) and v1.2.0 (the other project), CLAP version, 64-bit. When I open the projects with Bitwig 5 Beta 2, the instance(s) of Surge won't load properly. Each instance of Surge yields the message, ""Could not load plug-in. Could not load initial plug-in state: Couldn't load the plugin state"".

Attempting to reload the plug-in doesn't help. The only option is to load a new instance of Surge XT, but this results in losing any Bitwig modulators that were assigned to the existing instance of the synth.

I've also tried reinstalling Surge XT 1.2.0, and that didn't help (although Surge still opens fine in Bitwig 4.3.10).

I've reported this issue to Bitwig tech support as well.

When using REAPER (which I'll henceforth capitalize as ""Reaper"") and attempting to resize Surge beyond single-screen size, you are unable to scroll up/down or left/right to view the entire GUI. Trying to manually shrink/unshrink the window to ""trick"" the scrollbars into appearing likewise does not work.

**Surge XT Version**
1.1.2

* Version: As previously stated, 1.1.2
* Plugin Type: [VST2, VST3, AU] VST3 and CLAP
* Bitness: [32-bit or 64-bit] 64

**Reproduction Steps:**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Reaper
2. Load Surge
3. Change zoom level to something beyond the capabilities of a single screen to show at once
4. See error

**Expected Behavior:**
Scrollbars should appear if the plugin real estate is larger than the available window/screen real estate.

**Screenshots:**
I can post if deemed necessary.

Doing that we cause recreating all sliders. But we also repaint some components that cause repainting the sliders of the modulation source and we have that blinking. To prevent that, I set `needsModUpdate = true;` instead of calling `refresh_mod()` so that 'refresh_mod()' would only cause one repainting.

Learn that scene A has keytracking assigned to a timbre param, and scene B has the exact same assignment via the stopped saw LFO phase mod-mapping trick.

Play a scale from C4 up to C6 in Scene A
Switch to Scene B and play the same scale again
Ponder why those behave differently
Proft?!!

Very minor thing, but when holding Ctrl and dragging **quickly** across the steps in the step sequencer modulator to clear out all the steps in one swipe, it will sometimes leave some steps untouched, meaning you have to go back and clear them afterwards.

Also, when holding down Ctrl and then moving the mouse outside of the bounds of the step sequencer and dragging, it doesn't clear the steps, when in reality it should (just like it does fill the steps if you don't hold down Ctrl).

Trace98 — Yesterday at 6:55 PM
Hello, 
-using Vintage Ladder (Type 1 not Type 2) in filter 2, in any configuration where the filter comes after an active waveshaper
using one of the following
 (soft medium hard ojd sine add13 add15 addsqr3 full rect halfpos halfneg sft1fold 1fold 2fold wcfold and from sin+x onward)
causes the cpu to spike up to 100 immediately.
Adding to the weirdness the bug doesn't happen when pressing 3 or more notes simultaneously at the same time;
it only happens when pressing 1 or 2 notes, after the bug manifests adding other ntoes won't fix it.
Sometimes it doesn't happen instantly, it takes a moment or some note ons, but after it happens it stays there
-Reaper v6.78, Win 10,  both CLAP and VST3, latest surge nightly 1.2.nightly.7473f5e (bug happened even in b6c8442)
baconpaul — Yesterday at 7:00 PM
Are you in stereo routing? If you put it in mono routing does the problem resolve with 5 notes?
The vintage ladders are deterministic not iterative so something must be either causing a nan or under flow
(but we have software denormals off)
Trace98 — Yesterday at 7:05 PM
it's a bit weird, i'm testing a bit
by mono routing you mean every routing but wide and l-r right?
baconpaul — Yesterday at 7:06 PM
Yeah like s1 is perfect
Trace98 — Yesterday at 7:08 PM
yeah happens there too
with 1 2 3 5 5 7 notes simultaneously
with 4 or 8 notes it resolves
it's hard to track everything, now when switching between modes the bug persisted. it's very erratic
baconpaul — Yesterday at 7:15 PM
Great can you save your crashing patch as an fxp so I can try it?
```

my theory is that the model is getting an inactive voice in the simd slot (as all models do) but something about the model and un-initialized is making it run away or nan out.

There seems to be an issue with filesystem access in Surge XT in Windows 10. I have encountered a number of problems:

1. could not create a ""Surge XT"" folder under C:\users\<me>\Documents
2. could not open SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml for writing when switching skins from the default to Surge Dark
3. Exception occurred while creating category folder when saving any preset. 

**Surge XT Version**

* Version: 1.1.2d3568a9 also NIGHTLY-2023-03-21-06a6c9e
* Plugin Type: CLAP, also standalone
* Bitness: 64 bit

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. install Surge XT from the main website
2. launch Surge XT from the start menu
3. observe the first error, unable to create Surge XT folder in C:\users\<me>\Documents

1. create a Surge XT folder manually (if this is not done, Surge crashes upon selection of the skin)
2. click the menu button and select ""Skins...Surge Dark""
3. observe the error ""could not open SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml for writing""
4. create a SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml manually
5. close Surge XT
6. reopen Surge XT, notice that the skin is back to the default
7. attempt to change the skin to Surge Dark again, observe the error once more
8. notice that the manually created SurgeXTUserDefaults.xml is still 0 bytes

1. in the main Surge XT window, click ""Save""
2. change the category from ""Templates"" to ""abc""
3. leave the name ""Init Saw""
4. change Author to ""abc""
5. click save, observe the error ""Exception occurred while creating category! Most likely, invalid characters were used to name the category...""
6. click ok

**OTHER STEPS**

1. click the patch name to open the patch browser
2. under Functions, click open user patches folder
3. nothing happens
4. click ""open factory patches folder"" 
5. observe that the factory patches folder opens

**Expected Behavior:**

1. expected user folder to be created
2. expected user defaults file to be created
3. expected to be able to switch skins permanently
4. expected to be able to save user patches
5. expected to be able to open the user patches folder from the patches browser

Make osc1 a Sine osc (makes it easy to hear the issue)
Attach an LFO to osc1 mixer slider
Play a bass note and bring the LFO rate up.
You'll hear an alias-like ringing that gets louder as LFO rate increases.

Curiously, the frequency of the ringing is constant no matter what note you play, and no matter what the LFO rate is; only its amplitude changes. It seems rooted at around 6k.

And also curiously, if you oversample this block size-8 Surge, the frequency changes as expected (goes to ≈12k at 2x OS etc), but if you use the default block size 32, the problem dissappears from consequential ranges. Introducing some totally overkill treble boost CPU, it does seem like a similar ringing might actually be present also at BS=32, but it's much much quieter. I would've never found it if I wasn't trying to.

This begins to fix it for the VST3 and AU with the VST3 being most important, since FL does this all the time.

What we do here is: if a block is handed to us with a non-multiple of BLOCK_SIZE we just start lagging the input. We don't turn on latent processing in the synth, we don't do it in the CLAP, and we don't show a user error. Clearly this requires more thought but it will stop randomly distorted and crashing behavior, at least, in the case where you don't have uniform blocks.
